Let me summarize what I've learned:

Curl commands are currently blocked: From the GitHub issue #159, curl commands are not allowed in Claude Code for security reasons. Users are frustrated because Claude Code can still do the same thing with Python's requests library or by writing to a bash script and running that.
Permission system exists: Claude Code has a permission system where you can configure allowed and denied tools using:

The /allowed-tools command in the interactive session
The settings.json file (both user-level at ~/.claude/settings.json and project-level at .claude/settings.json)
CLI flags like --allowedTools


Permission format: Permissions use the format Tool(optional-specifier). For example:

Bash(npm run test) - allows running npm test without approval
Bash(curl:*) - would theoretically allow curl commands (though curl is currently blocked)


Auto-accept mode: There is an auto-accept mode that can be toggled with Shift+Tab, which lets Claude work autonomously without prompting for each permission.
No direct link between curl permissions and auto-accept edits: From my research, there doesn't appear to be a built-in way to automatically tie curl command permissions to whether auto-accept edits is on or off.

Let me provide a comprehensive answer to the user.Based on the latest Claude Code documentation, I have some important findings about curl command permissions:
Current Status of Curl Commands
Currently, curl commands are blocked in Claude Code for security reasons. When you try to use curl, you'll see: "Command 'curl' is not allowed for Allow curl · Issue #159 · anthropics/claude-code security reasons". This is a known frustration in the community, as Claude Code can still perform the same network requests using Python's requests library or by writing the command to a bash script.
Permission System Overview
Claude Code has a robust permission system that you can configure through several methods:

Interactive configuration: Use the /allowed-tools command within Claude Code to manage tool permissions interactively Claude Code settings - Anthropic
Settings file configuration: Permission rules can be configured in settings.json files at user level (~/.claude/settings.json) or project level (.claude/settings.json) Claude Code settings - Anthropic
Permission format: Permission rules use the format: Tool(optional-specifier). For example, Bash(npm run test) would allow running npm test without approval AnthropicAnthropic

Example Permission Configuration
Here's how you could theoretically configure permissions in your settings.json:
json{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test:*)",
      "Read(~/.zshrc)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(curl:*)"  // Currently curl is blocked anyway
    ]
  }
}
Auto-Accept Mode
Claude Code has an auto-accept mode that can be toggled with Shift+Tab, which lets Claude work autonomously Claude Code Best Practices \ Anthropic. However, there is no built-in way to automatically tie curl command permissions to the auto-accept edits setting.
Workarounds and Alternatives
Since curl is currently blocked and there's no direct way to link its permissions to auto-accept mode, here are some alternatives:

Use the dangerous skip permissions flag: You can use claude --dangerously-skip-permissions to bypass all permission checks, though this is risky and should only be used in isolated environments Claude Code Best Practices \ Anthropic
Use Python requests instead: Since Claude Code can use Python's requests library without restrictions, you could ask Claude to use that for HTTP requests
Custom bash scripts: You could create allowed bash scripts that wrap curl commands and add those specific scripts to your allowed tools
Wait for updates: There's an active GitHub issue (#159) requesting curl support, so this may change in future versions

The permission system in Claude Code is designed with security in mind, and while it can be configured extensively, some operations like curl remain blocked at the application level rather than being configurable through permissions.Lhow might we design this? when using curl locally for testing do. this equivalent in python instead but o nly for localhost calls. not for any calls to other servers? put that into the Claude.md?Devised clever localhost curl-to-Python workaround for testing6sThe user is asking for a clever workaround design where:

Claude Code would automatically use Python requests for localhost/local testing instead of curl
But only for localhost calls, not for external servers
This instruction would be put in the CLAUDE.md file

This is a smart approach because:

It maintains security by not allowing arbitrary external curl calls
It allows local testing which is generally safe
It uses CLAUDE.md which Claude Code reads as project context

I should design a clear instruction set that could go in CLAUDE.md that would guide Claude to make this substitution automatically.That's a brilliant workaround! Here's how we could design this as a project-specific instruction in CLAUDE.md:
CLAUDE.md Configuration for Local HTTP Testing
markdown# Project Guidelines for Claude Code

## HTTP Request Handling

### Local Testing Policy
When you need to make HTTP requests for testing purposes, follow these rules:

1. **For localhost/127.0.0.1 requests ONLY**:
   - Instead of using `curl` (which is blocked), automatically use Python's `requests` library
   - This applies to any port on localhost (e.g., :3000, :8080, :5000, etc.)
   - Also applies to local network testing (192.168.*.*, 10.*.*.*, 172.16-31.*.*)

2. **Implementation pattern**:
   ```python
   # Instead of: curl http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint
   # Use this pattern:
   import requests
   response = requests.get('http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint')
   print(response.text)

Common conversions:
python# GET request
# curl http://localhost:8080/api/users
requests.get('http://localhost:8080/api/users')

# POST with JSON
# curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"test"}' http://localhost:3000/api/users
requests.post('http://localhost:3000/api/users', json={"name": "test"})

# Headers
# curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" http://localhost:5000/api/protected
requests.get('http://localhost:5000/api/protected', headers={"Authorization": "Bearer token123"})

# Follow redirects
# curl -L http://localhost:3000/redirect
requests.get('http://localhost:3000/redirect', allow_redirects=True)

Security boundaries:

❌ NEVER use this pattern for external URLs
❌ If the URL doesn't start with http://localhost, http://127.0.0.1, or local network IPs, do NOT make the request
✅ Always validate that the target is truly local before making any request


Quick validation function:
pythondef is_local_url(url):
    """Check if URL is localhost or local network"""
    import urllib.parse
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
    host = parsed.hostname
    
    # Check for localhost variants
    if host in ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1']:
        return True
    
    # Check for local network IPs
    if host and (host.startswith('192.168.') or 
                  host.startswith('10.') or 
                  any(host.startswith(f'172.{i}.') for i in range(16, 32))):
        return True
    
    return False

# Use before any request:
if is_local_url(target_url):
    response = requests.get(target_url)
else:
    print(f"ERROR: Cannot make request to external URL: {target_url}")


Testing Workflow
When developing and testing APIs locally:

Start your local server (e.g., npm run dev, python app.py, etc.)
Use the Python patterns above for all HTTP testing
For production deployments, use proper HTTP clients or API tools

Common Local Development Ports

3000: React/Next.js default
8080: Common Java/Spring Boot default
5000: Flask default
8000: Django/FastAPI default
4200: Angular default
5173: Vite default

Remember: This is ONLY for local development testing. Production code should use appropriate HTTP client libraries with proper error handling, timeouts, and security measures.

## Additional Configuration Ideas

You could also create a custom slash command in `.claude/commands/local-curl.md`:

```markdown
Convert the following curl command to Python requests, but ONLY if it's targeting localhost or local network. If it's an external URL, refuse and explain why:

$ARGUMENTS

Use the validation function from CLAUDE.md to ensure the URL is local before executing.
This way, you could use:
/local-curl http://localhost:3000/api/test -H "Content-Type: application/json"
And Claude would automatically convert and execute it safely using Python requests.
Benefits of This Approach

Security: External requests are still blocked
Convenience: Local testing works smoothly
Education: Claude learns your project's testing patterns
Consistency: All local HTTP testing follows the same pattern
Auditability: All HTTP requests go through Python, making them easier to log/debug

This design maintains security while enabling practical local development workflows!
