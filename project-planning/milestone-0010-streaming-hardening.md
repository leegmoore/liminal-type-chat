# Milestone 0010: Streaming Hardening

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Objective**: Improve the streaming capabilities of the application, optimize performance, handle edge cases, and ensure reliable delivery of AI responses.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Streaming Performance Optimization**:
   - Identify and address bottlenecks in the streaming implementation
   - Optimize memory usage during streaming operations
   - Implement proper backpressure handling

2. **Error Handling and Recovery**:
   - Implement robust error handling for streaming interruptions
   - Add automatic retry mechanisms for recoverable errors
   - Provide graceful degradation when streaming is unavailable

3. **Connection Management**:
   - Implement proper connection timeout and keepalive strategies
   - Add connection pooling for high-throughput scenarios
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources when connections end

4. **Client-Side Improvements**:
   - Enhance client-side buffering and rendering of streamed content
   - Add visual feedback for streaming status (connecting, streaming, interrupted, etc.)
   - Implement progressive rendering optimizations

5. **Testing and Monitoring**:
   - Create comprehensive tests for streaming edge cases
   - Add performance benchmarks and metrics
   - Implement monitoring for streaming health

## Success Criteria

- Streaming remains stable under high load conditions
- Proper handling of all identified edge cases
- Improved user experience with streaming responses
- Comprehensive test coverage for streaming components
