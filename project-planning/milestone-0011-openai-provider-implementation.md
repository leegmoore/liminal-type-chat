# Milestone 0011: OpenAI Provider Implementation

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Objective**: Implement OpenAI provider to enable multi-model support in the Liminal platform
- **Note**: Re-prioritized after auth removal to build multi-provider capability first

## Key Deliverables

1. **OpenAI Service Implementation**:
   - Create `OpenAIService.ts` implementing the `ILlmService` interface
   - Ensure compatibility with existing LLM service patterns
   - Implement proper initialization and configuration
   - Add to `LlmServiceFactory` for seamless integration

2. **Model Support**:
   - GPT-4 (latest stable version)
   - GPT-4 Turbo (128k context window)
   - GPT-3.5 Turbo (cost-effective option)
   - Proper model parameter mapping
   - Context window management per model

3. **Streaming Response Handling**:
   - Implement OpenAI streaming API integration
   - Convert OpenAI stream format to internal AsyncIterable format
   - Handle stream interruptions and partial responses
   - Ensure compatibility with existing streaming infrastructure

4. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**:
   - Rate limit handling with exponential backoff
   - API error mapping to internal error codes
   - Graceful degradation for service outages
   - Proper error messages for user feedback
   - Request timeout management

5. **API Key Validation**:
   - Startup validation of OpenAI API keys
   - Runtime key rotation support
   - Clear error messages for invalid keys
   - Integration with existing `LlmApiKeyManager`

6. **Model Selection in UI**:
   - Add model selector component to chat interface
   - Display available models based on provider
   - Show model capabilities (context window, features)
   - Persist user's model preference
   - Real-time model switching without losing context

## Success Criteria

- All OpenAI models successfully integrated and tested
- Streaming responses work seamlessly with existing infrastructure
- Error handling covers all edge cases with proper user feedback
- Model selection UI is intuitive and responsive
- Performance benchmarks show acceptable latency
- Unit tests achieve 90% coverage for service implementation
- Integration tests pass for all supported models
- Documentation updated with OpenAI-specific configuration

## Technical Approach

1. Follow existing patterns from `AnthropicService.ts`
2. Use OpenAI Node.js SDK for API integration
3. Maintain provider abstraction through `ILlmService`
4. Ensure no OpenAI-specific code leaks into domain layer
5. Support both streaming and non-streaming modes
