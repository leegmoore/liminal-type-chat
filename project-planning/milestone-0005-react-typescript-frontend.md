# Milestone 0005: React TypeScript Frontend with Health Check Features

- **Status**: completed
- **Objective**: Create a modern React TypeScript frontend with build deployment to the Express server, comprehensive testing, and health check functionality.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  1.  **React Application Setup**:
      - Initialize React app with TypeScript support
      - Configure appropriate linting and formatting
      - Create base application structure with routing
  2.  **Build & Deployment**:
      - Configure build process to output to a `build` directory
      - Create npm script to copy built assets to the server's `/public` folder
      - Add deployment documentation
  3.  **Testing Infrastructure**:
      - Set up Jest with React Testing Library
      - Configure test coverage reporting with 90% threshold
      - Add test helpers and utilities
  4.  **Health Check Interface**:
      - Create responsive UI with a clean, modern design
      - Implement health check page with two buttons:
        - Server health check button (calls `/api/v1/edge/health`)
        - Database health check button (calls `/api/v1/edge/health/db`)
      - Display results with appropriate visual feedback (success/error states)
      - Add loading states during API calls
  5.  **Component Tests**:
      - Unit tests for all components
      - Integration tests for health check API interactions
      - Mock API responses for predictable testing
- **Success Criteria**:
  - 90% test coverage across the React codebase
  - Successful build and deployment to Express server's public directory
  - Health check buttons correctly call their respective endpoints and display results
  - Responsive design works on various screen sizes
