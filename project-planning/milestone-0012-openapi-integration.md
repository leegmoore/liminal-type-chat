# Milestone 0012: OpenAPI Integration

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Objective**: Develop a comprehensive OpenAPI specification for all endpoints, enabling better API documentation, client generation, and testing.

## Key Deliverables

1. **OpenAPI Specification Development**:
   - Define complete OpenAPI 3.x specification for all API endpoints
   - Include detailed request/response schemas based on JSON Schema definitions
   - Document authentication and authorization requirements
   - Add examples for all operations

2. **API Documentation**:
   - Integrate Swagger UI for interactive API documentation
   - Generate static documentation for offline use
   - Add detailed operation descriptions and usage guidelines
   - Include practical examples for common use cases

3. **Client Generation Framework**:
   - Set up tooling for automatic client code generation
   - Create TypeScript client library for frontend use
   - Document client generation process for third-party developers
   - Implement version management for API clients

4. **Testing Integration**:
   - Generate API tests from OpenAPI specification
   - Implement contract testing based on specification
   - Create validation middleware for request/response validation
   - Set up automated testing pipeline for API conformance

5. **Developer Experience Improvements**:
   - Add API explorer in development environment
   - Implement mock servers based on OpenAPI specification
   - Create developer guides for API usage
   - Add API changelog automation

## Success Criteria

- Complete OpenAPI specification covering all API endpoints
- Functional Swagger UI integration with interactive documentation
- Successfully generated and working TypeScript client
- Automated API tests with high coverage
- Improved developer experience with API exploration tools
