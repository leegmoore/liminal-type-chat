# Milestone 0004: Edge-to-Domain Pattern Implementation for Health Checks

- **Status**: completed
- **Objective**: Implement both edge and domain routes for our health checks, with the edge-to-domain adapter pattern, and validate with comprehensive integration tests.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  1.  **Domain API Routes & Services**:
      - `/api/v1/domain/health` endpoint in the domain routes
      - `/api/v1/domain/health/db` endpoint in the domain routes
      - Core health service implementation that the domain routes call
  2.  **Edge-to-Domain Adapter**:
      - Domain client adapter with configurable mode (direct/HTTP)
      - Configuration toggle via environment variable
  3.  **Edge API Routes**:
      - `/api/v1/edge/health` in edge routes using the domain client
      - `/api/v1/edge/health/db` in edge routes using the domain client
  4.  **Comprehensive Testing**:
      - Unit tests for the domain client adapter (testing both modes)
      - Integration tests for domain routes (`/api/v1/domain/health` and `/api/v1/domain/health/db`)
      - Integration tests for edge routes (`/api/v1/edge/health` and `/api/v1/edge/health/db`)
      - End-to-end test that verifies the entire flow with the adapter in HTTP mode
- **Success Criteria**:
  - 90% test coverage for the domain client adapter
  - All integration tests passing in both direct and HTTP modes
  - Configuration change (environment variable) successfully toggles adapter behavior without code changes
