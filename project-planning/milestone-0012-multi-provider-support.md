# Milestone 0012: Multi-Provider Support

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Objective**: Add support for multiple LLM providers beyond Anthropic and OpenAI, enabling a flexible platform for diverse AI models.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Google Gemini Provider Implementation**:
   - Implement full Gemini API integration
   - Support for Gemini Pro and other available models
   - Handle Gemini-specific features (multi-modal inputs, safety settings)
   - Streaming response support

2. **Unified Provider Interface Refinements**:
   - Enhance existing ILlmService interface for multi-provider compatibility
   - Standardize request/response handling across all providers
   - Implement provider-agnostic error handling
   - Create abstraction for provider-specific capabilities

3. **Provider Selection UI**:
   - Add provider/model selection dropdown in chat interface
   - Display available models based on configured providers
   - Show provider-specific capabilities and limitations
   - Remember user's preferred provider/model combination

4. **Model Comparison Features**:
   - Side-by-side response comparison from different providers
   - Performance metrics (response time, token usage)
   - Cost estimation per provider/model
   - Quality evaluation tools

5. **Provider-Specific Configuration**:
   - Environment-based provider configuration
   - Per-provider API key management
   - Model-specific parameter tuning (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
   - Provider feature toggles

6. **Consider Vercel AI SDK for Rapid Integration**:
   - Evaluate Vercel AI SDK for standardized provider interfaces
   - Assess compatibility with existing architecture
   - Potential migration path from custom implementations
   - Leverage built-in streaming and edge runtime support

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Completion of Milestone 0011 (Chat Interface Refinement Pt1)
- **Required**: Stable streaming architecture from Milestone 0010
- **Nice to have**: OpenAPI specification for provider APIs

## Technical Considerations

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Anthropic integration
- Ensure consistent streaming behavior across all providers
- Handle rate limiting and quota management per provider
- Support for provider-specific authentication methods
- Extensible architecture for future provider additions

## Success Criteria

- Successfully integrated at least 3 LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini)
- Seamless provider switching in UI without page reload
- Consistent response format across all providers
- Performance parity with single-provider implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage for all provider integrations

## Impact

This milestone enables the AI Roundtable feature planned for Milestone 0013, where multiple AI models can participate in collaborative conversations. It also positions the platform as provider-agnostic, reducing vendor lock-in and enabling users to choose the best model for their specific needs.
