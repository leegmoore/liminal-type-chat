# Milestone 0013: AI Roundtable MVP

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Objective**: Implement AI Roundtable - our key differentiating feature that enables multi-AI conversations with distinct personalities and expertise
- **Dependencies**: Requires multi-provider support from milestone 0012

## Key Deliverables

1. **Named AI Panelist System**:
   - Create panelist configuration structure (Name + Expertise + Model)
   - Implement panelist persona management
   - Support for different AI models per panelist
   - Panelist profile storage and retrieval

2. **@mention System**:
   - Parse @mentions in user messages
   - Route questions to specific panelists
   - Support @all for addressing entire panel
   - Visual indicators for mentions in UI

3. **Multi-Stream Orchestration**:
   - Concurrent response generation from multiple AIs
   - Stream multiplexing for parallel responses
   - Response queuing and ordering logic
   - Handle partial responses and failures gracefully

4. **Fair Scheduling**:
   - Implement round-robin or priority-based scheduling
   - Prevent dominant speakers from monopolizing conversation
   - Allow natural conversation flow between panelists
   - Support interruption and follow-up mechanisms

5. **Conversation Context Management**:
   - Maintain shared conversation history for all panelists
   - Track who said what (attribution)
   - Context windowing for long conversations
   - Panelist-specific memory and expertise tracking

6. **UI for Roundtable Conversations**:
   - Multi-column or threaded view for concurrent responses
   - Visual differentiation between panelists
   - Real-time streaming updates from multiple sources
   - Panelist avatars and visual identity

7. **Pre-built Panel Templates**:
   - Technical Review Panel (Frontend, Backend, Security experts)
   - Creative Brainstorming Panel (Writer, Designer, Strategist)
   - Code Review Panel (different language experts)
   - Academic Panel (various domain experts)
   - Customizable panel creation

## Technical Requirements

- Extension of existing streaming infrastructure
- Support for multiple concurrent LLM connections
- Efficient context sharing between panelists
- Scalable message routing system
- Panel configuration persistence

## Success Criteria

- Functional @mention system directing questions appropriately
- Smooth concurrent streaming from multiple AI panelists
- Clear visual distinction between different panelists
- Natural conversation flow between AI participants
- At least 3 pre-built panel templates
- Performance handling 5+ concurrent AI streams
- Comprehensive test coverage for orchestration logic

## Platform Significance

This is the platform's signature feature as described in the PRD - the "AI Roundtable" that differentiates us from single-assistant chat interfaces. It enables:
- Multiple perspectives on complex problems
- Specialized expertise from different AI models
- Dynamic, engaging multi-party conversations
- Educational value through AI debates and discussions
