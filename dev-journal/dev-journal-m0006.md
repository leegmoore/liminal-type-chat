# Development Journal: Milestone 0006 - Core ContextThread Domain Layer

**Date:** May 12, 2025  
**Milestone:** 0006 (Core ContextThread Domain Layer)  
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

Milestone 0006 focused on implementing the core domain logic for managing `ContextThread`s and `Message`s, including data models, persistence, domain services, and domain API routes. This milestone represents a significant step in the application architecture, establishing the foundation for the conversation functionality that is core to the chat application.

## Implementation Details

### Domain Models

We implemented the canonical domain entities for `ContextThread` and `Message` as TypeScript interfaces in `server/src/types/domain.ts`:

- **Message**: Represents a single message within a ContextThread
  - Properties: id, threadId, role, content, createdAt, metadata (optional), status (optional)
  
- **ContextThread**: Represents a conversation thread containing messages
  - Properties: id, title (optional), createdAt, updatedAt, metadata (optional), messages array

### Database Implementation

The database schema for `context_threads` was implemented in SQLite, with messages stored as a JSON string directly within the thread record. This denormalized approach simplifies the MVP by reducing the need for complex queries and joins.

### Repository Layer

`ContextThreadRepository` was implemented to handle CRUD operations with the following responsibilities:
- Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting threads
- Converting between database (snake_case) and domain (camelCase) model formats
- Parsing and stringifying JSON data (messages, metadata)
- Error handling for JSON parsing failures

Unit tests were implemented with 93.75% coverage, covering the core functionality, error handling, and edge cases.

### Service Layer

`ContextThreadService` was implemented to handle business logic with these responsibilities:
- Generating UUIDs and timestamps for new threads and messages
- Managing thread operations (create, get, update, delete)
- Managing message operations (add, update)
- Calling `normalizeThreadMessages` utility before saving threads

The service has 97.36% test coverage, ensuring robust handling of core operations.

### Utilities

We implemented the `normalizeThreadMessages` utility which is currently responsible for sorting messages by `createdAt` timestamp. This provides a foundation for future enhancements such as handling streaming, race conditions, and interrupted messages.

### Domain API Routes

Domain API routes were implemented in `server/src/routes/domain/context-thread.ts`, exposing CRUD operations for threads and messages through a RESTful interface:

- **Thread Operations**
  - POST /api/v1/domain/threads - Create a new thread
  - GET /api/v1/domain/threads/:id - Get a thread by ID
  - PUT /api/v1/domain/threads/:id - Update a thread
  - DELETE /api/v1/domain/threads/:id - Delete a thread
  
- **Message Operations**
  - POST /api/v1/domain/threads/:id/messages - Add a message to a thread
  - GET /api/v1/domain/threads/:id/messages - Get all messages in a thread
  - PUT /api/v1/domain/threads/:id/messages/:messageId - Update a message

The routes achieved 90.66% test coverage, including error paths and edge cases.

## Testing Approach

We followed a rigorous testing approach for all components:

1. **Repository Tests**: Mock SQLite driver; test all CRUD operations, error handling, and data mapping
2. **Service Tests**: Mock repository; test business logic, ID/timestamp generation, and error handling
3. **Domain API Route Tests**: Mock service; test HTTP handling, status codes, and response formats

Coverage metrics achieved:
- ContextThreadRepository: 93.75% statement coverage
- ContextThreadService: 97.36% statement coverage
- Domain API routes: 90.66% statement coverage
- normalizeThreadMessages: 100% statement coverage

## Challenges and Solutions

### Async Route Handlers
Initially, route handlers were using unnecessary `async` keywords for synchronous operations, which caused test timeouts. We optimized the route handlers by removing the async wrappers where not needed.

### JSON Parsing Error Handling
We implemented a custom `MessagesCorruptedError` to specifically handle JSON parsing failures, allowing for clear error messages and proper error propagation.

### Denormalization Trade-offs
We chose to denormalize the message data as a JSON string within the thread record for simplicity in the MVP. This decision trades some data integrity guarantees for implementation simplicity, with plans to reconsider in future iterations if necessary.

## Next Steps

With the domain layer in place, the next milestone will focus on implementing the edge tier API for ContextThreads, which will build on this foundation with proper validation, error handling, and client adapter pattern integration.

## Conclusion

Milestone 0006 successfully delivers the core domain functionality for managing context threads and messages, establishing a solid foundation for the chat functionality. The implementation follows the architectural principles of the project, with clear separation of concerns between repository, service, and API layers. The comprehensive test coverage ensures the reliability and correctness of these critical components.
