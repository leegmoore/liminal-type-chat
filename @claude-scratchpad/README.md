# Claude's Working Memory

This directory serves as external working memory to maintain context across messages and sessions.

## Structure

- **current/** - Active work. Start here!
- **sessions/** - Archived completed work organized by date
- **reference/** - Valuable findings to keep long-term

## Usage

1. Always work in `current/` directory
2. Use `todo.md` for task tracking
3. Archive to `sessions/` when done
4. Move valuable discoveries to `reference/`

See CLAUDE.md for detailed lifecycle rules.
