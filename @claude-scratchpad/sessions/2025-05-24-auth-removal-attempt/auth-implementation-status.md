# Auth Implementation Status

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ JWT token generation (was missing await)
2. ✅ Conversation routes authentication (added auth middleware)

## Current Issues
1. Domain routes are mounted incorrectly in app.ts
   - Individual routes mounted without auth
   - Should use createDomainApiRoutes which includes domain auth
   - This means domain endpoints are unprotected!

## Auth Architecture Status
- Edge Auth: ✅ Working (after conversation fix)
- Domain Auth: ❌ Not implemented (routes mounted without middleware)
- Auth Bridge: ❓ Can't test until domain auth is fixed

## Next Steps
1. Fix domain route mounting in app.ts
2. Test edge vs domain token requirements
3. Find/test token exchange mechanism
