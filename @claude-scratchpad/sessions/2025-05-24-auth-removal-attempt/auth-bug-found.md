# Auth Bug Investigation - RESOLVED

## Initial Issue (INCORRECT)
Initially thought conversation routes were NOT protected by authentication middleware.

## Investigation Results
After checking the code:
1. `src/routes/edge/conversation.ts` DOES import and use `createAuthMiddleware` (lines 18, 98-102)
2. `src/app.ts` properly passes jwtService and userRepository to createConversationRoutes (line 125)
3. Auth middleware is applied to ALL routes in the conversation router (lines 98-102)

## Actual Situation
- Conversation routes ARE protected by authentication middleware
- The middleware requires edge tier tokens with no specific scopes
- If BYPASS_AUTH=true is set, auth is bypassed (which may have caused confusion)

## Other Routes Status
- Chat routes: Protected (passes jwtService and userRepository)
- API Keys routes: Protected (passes jwtService and userRepository)
- Auth routes: Public by design (for login/OAuth)
- Health routes: Public by design
- Conversation routes: Protected (auth middleware applied)

## No Fix Required
The conversation routes are properly protected. The confusion may have come from testing with BYPASS_AUTH=true.
