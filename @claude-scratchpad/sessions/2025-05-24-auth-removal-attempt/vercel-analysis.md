# Vercel Deployment Analysis for Liminal-Type-Chat

## Critical Constraints for Your Architecture

### 1. **SSE/Streaming Limitations**
- Node.js runtime on Vercel = NO Server-Sent Events support
- Must use Edge Runtime for SSE (different API, not Express)
- Your app heavily relies on SSE for chat streaming

### 2. **Express.js Incompatibility**
- Cannot deploy custom Express server on Vercel
- Must convert to Vercel Functions (API routes)
- Major refactoring of your entire server structure

### 3. **SQLite Database Issue**
- Vercel is serverless (no persistent filesystem)
- SQLite needs local file storage
- Would need to migrate to cloud database (PostgreSQL, etc.)

### 4. **Function Timeouts**
- Vercel Functions have execution time limits
- Long-running AI conversations could hit timeouts
- Edge Runtime has different constraints

## Required Changes for Vercel

1. **Complete Server Rewrite**
   - Convert Express routes → Vercel Functions
   - Rewrite streaming to use Edge Runtime
   - Different API patterns

2. **Database Migration**
   - SQLite → PostgreSQL/MySQL (cloud)
   - Update all repositories
   - Handle connection pooling

3. **Architecture Changes**
   - Stateless functions only
   - No persistent connections
   - Different auth patterns

## Cost Implications

- **Hobby**: $0/mo (very limited)
- **Pro**: $20/mo per user (streaming enabled)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing
- Plus database hosting costs

## Alternative Recommendations

### Better Fits for Your Architecture:

1. **Railway.app**
   - Full Node.js/Express support
   - SQLite works fine
   - SSE fully supported
   - ~$5-20/mo

2. **Fly.io**
   - Persistent volumes for SQLite
   - Great streaming support
   - Global edge deployment
   - Pay per usage

3. **Render.com**
   - Express apps work as-is
   - Automatic deploys
   - Built-in database options
   - Free tier available

4. **Digital Ocean App Platform**
   - Traditional hosting model
   - Full control
   - Predictable pricing
   - $5-10/mo

## My Recommendation

**Don't use Vercel** for this project because:

1. Your Express + SSE architecture is incompatible
2. SQLite won't work without major changes
3. Would require complete rewrite
4. Better platforms exist for your use case

**Consider Vercel only if**:
- You want to rebuild as Next.js app
- You're willing to migrate to cloud database
- You need global edge deployment
- You want their DX and ecosystem

For your current architecture, Railway or Fly.io would deploy with minimal changes and cost less.
