# Investigation Log - Milestone 0009 Auth Testing

## Investigation Started: 2025-05-23

### Current Situation
- Working on Milestone 0009 (Security Hardening) - Phase 3: Edge-Domain Authentication Bridge
- Previous Claude got stuck testing auth and made changes that broke things
- Server is running with BYPASS_AUTH=true on port 8765
- API routes are returning HTML instead of JSON responses
- I made some route changes that may have made things worse

### Investigation Goals
1. Understand what the authentication bridge is supposed to do
2. Figure out why API routes return HTML
3. Determine what's broken vs what's working
4. Create minimal test plan to verify auth bridge functionality

### Agent Deployment
- Agent 1: Test Investigation - Understanding expected behavior from tests
- Agent 2: Route/Middleware Analysis - Why HTML is served instead of API responses  
- Agent 3: Git History Analysis - What changed and what was working
- Agent 4: Configuration Analysis - Environment and build setup
