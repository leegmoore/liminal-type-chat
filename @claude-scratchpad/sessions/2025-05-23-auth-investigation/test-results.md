# Hypothesis Testing Results

## Test 1: Catch-all Route Hypothesis

### Test 1.1: Check exact vs wrong API paths
- Both exact and wrong paths returned HTML
- Dashboard route worked fine
- **Result**: Catch-all is working but API routes aren't registered properly

## Test 2: Route Path Duplication Hypothesis

### Test 2.1: Check my route changes
- Found I changed routes from full paths to relative paths
- Also changed app.ts to mount with base paths
- **Result**: This created a mismatch

### Test 2.2: Revert changes and test
- Reverted both files to original state
- Rebuilt and restarted server
- `/api/v1/edge/health` now returns JSON: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-05-23T05:36:42.366Z"}`
- **Result**: CONFIRMED - My changes broke the routes
