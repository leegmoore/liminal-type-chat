# React Rendering Error - Systematic Analysis

## Current Situation
- Error: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {})"
- Occurs after OAuth token exchange
- Previous fix attempt (changing profileImageUrl to null) did NOT work
- Error still persists

## Hypotheses

### H1: Token is an object, not a string
- The server might be returning `token: {}` instead of `token: "jwt-string"`
- AuthTester expects token to be a string (line 160: `setToken(tokenValue)`)
- If token is an empty object, rendering it in JSX would cause this error

### H2: Server response structure issue
- The response might have other fields that are empty objects
- Even though we handle tokenInfo filtering, other fields might slip through

### H3: JWT generation is failing
- The server might be failing to generate a JWT and returning an empty object
- Line 188 in auth.ts: `await jwtService.generateToken(...)` might be returning `{}`

### H4: User object has nested empty objects
- The user object from the database might contain empty objects in nested fields
- These could be passed through to the response

### H5: Response is being modified by middleware
- Error handling or other middleware might be wrapping/modifying the response

## Reflection on Hypotheses

**Most Likely: H1 or H3**
- The error specifically mentions "object with keys {}" which sounds like an empty object
- The token is directly rendered in the UI (line 326: `{token || ''}`)
- If generateToken is returning {} instead of a string, this would cause the exact error we're seeing

**Less Likely: H2, H4, H5**
- H2: We already filter tokenInfo for empty objects
- H4: User fields are explicitly mapped in the response
- H5: Would likely cause different error patterns

## Testing Plan

1. ✓ Added console.log to auth.ts to see what generateToken returns
2. ✓ Added defensive checks in AuthTester for token type
3. Next: Check the actual server response in browser DevTools when error occurs
4. If token is the issue, trace why generateToken returns an object

## Progress
- Server keeps shutting down - need to monitor stability
- Added logging to capture token generation
- Added comprehensive error handling in client
- Waiting for OAuth flow test to see actual error details
