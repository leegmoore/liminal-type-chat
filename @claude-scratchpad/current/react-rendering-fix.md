# React Rendering Error - RESOLVED

## Issue
React rendering error after successful OAuth token exchange:
- Error: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {})"

## Root Cause
In `server/src/routes/edge/auth.ts` line 203:
- Was trying to use `user.authProviders.github?.identity` as `profileImageUrl`
- The issue was likely that the optional chaining returned an unexpected value
- `identity` is a string (username), not an image URL

## Fix Applied
Changed line 203 to return `profileImageUrl: null` instead of accessing the identity field incorrectly.

## Testing Status
âœ… **VERIFIED WORKING** - OAuth flow completes successfully:
- Token is properly generated as a string
- User info is returned correctly
- No React rendering errors
- JWT contains correct claims (user ID, email, name, scopes, tier)

## Future Enhancement
To properly support profile images:
1. Add `profileImageUrl` field to the User model
2. Store the `pictureUrl` from OAuth profile when creating/updating users
3. Return the actual profile image URL in the auth response
