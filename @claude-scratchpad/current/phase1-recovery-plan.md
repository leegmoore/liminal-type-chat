# Phase 1 Auth Removal - Recovery Plan

## Current Situation
The previous engineer attempted auth removal and deleted files, but:
1. Server won't start properly (process management issues, not auth-related)
2. Can't verify if the auth removal actually works
3. Multiple node processes were competing for port 8765

## What Was Already Done (Based on Git Status)
### Deleted Files (31 total):
- All `/providers/auth/` directory
- All auth middleware files
- Auth route files
- Frontend AuthTester component
- Frontend authService

### Modified Files:
- server/src/app.ts
- server/src/routes/domain/context-thread.ts
- server/src/routes/edge/*.ts (multiple)
- client/src/App.tsx
- client/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx

## Recovery Steps

### Step 1: Fix Server Process Issues
1. Kill all node processes
2. Clear any lock files
3. Start server with plain node (not nodemon)
4. Verify server actually responds on port 8765

### Step 2: Assess Current Code State
1. Check if modified files have proper mock user implementation
2. Verify no lingering auth imports causing crashes
3. Ensure all auth middleware was properly removed from routes

### Step 3: Fix Compilation/Runtime Errors
1. Run TypeScript compilation to find missing imports
2. Fix any undefined references to removed auth code
3. Add mock user objects where needed

### Step 4: Run Tests and Lint
1. Update tests that expect auth
2. Fix lint errors from removed imports
3. Ensure coverage meets standards

## Critical Areas to Check
1. Mock user implementation in routes
2. Removed auth imports in app.ts
3. Frontend no longer calls auth endpoints
4. API key service works without auth
