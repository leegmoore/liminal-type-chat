# Phase 1 Completion Action Plan

## Thinking Token Estimate: ~50,000 tokens
This will require careful analysis of partially modified code, fixing compilation errors, and ensuring all systems work without auth.

## Agent Requirements: 3-4 concurrent agents

### Agent 1: Process Cleanup & Server Fix
- Kill all node processes
- Fix server startup issues
- Verify server responds on port 8765
- Test basic health endpoints

### Agent 2: Code Compilation Fix
- Analyze TypeScript compilation errors
- Fix missing imports and references
- Implement mock user pattern consistently
- Ensure all routes work without auth

### Agent 3: Frontend Cleanup
- Remove auth-related code from ChatPage
- Fix any API calls expecting auth
- Ensure UI works without login

### Agent 4: Test & Lint Fix
- Update all tests to work without auth
- Fix lint errors from removed imports
- Achieve required coverage levels

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1A: Immediate Server Recovery (15 min)
1. Kill all processes: `pkill -f node`
2. Check for database locks
3. Start server with: `cd server && node dist/server.js`
4. Verify with: `curl http://localhost:8765/health`

### Phase 1B: Code Fixes (2-3 hours)
Deploy agents 2 & 3 in parallel to:
- Fix compilation errors
- Add mock user objects
- Remove auth expectations from frontend

### Phase 1C: Test Suite (1-2 hours)
Deploy agent 4 to:
- Update test expectations
- Fix coverage gaps
- Ensure all tests pass

### Phase 1D: Final Verification (30 min)
- Full system test
- Lint passes
- Coverage meets standards
- Commit working state

## Success Criteria
1. Server runs on port 8765
2. All endpoints accessible without auth
3. All tests pass
4. Lint passes
5. Coverage >= 75% edge, >= 90% domain
6. Can create conversations and chat without login
