# Auth Testing Status Summary

## What's Working
- All API routes are properly responding (not returning HTML anymore)
- BYPASS_AUTH=true allows access to edge endpoints without tokens
- OAuth flow initiates successfully
- Token exchange endpoint responds (200 OK, 153 bytes)

## Current Blocker
- React rendering error after successful token exchange
- Error: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {})"
- Previous fix for empty tokenInfo is in place but error persists
- This is where previous Claude got stuck and started breaking things

## Next Steps (When We Return)
1. Identify what object is being rendered incorrectly (likely in AuthTester.tsx)
2. Fix the rendering issue
3. Complete auth bridge testing per original plan

## Important Note
- The auth system appears to be working correctly
- The issue is purely a React UI rendering problem
- No need to modify backend auth code
