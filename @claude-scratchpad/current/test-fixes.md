# Server Test Fixes After Auth Removal

## Initial Assessment
- All tests are passing! (57 test suites, 593 tests total)
- This is surprising given the extensive auth removal
- Need to investigate why tests still pass and if there are any auth references to clean up

## Files to Investigate
Found 25 test files that may contain auth-related references:
1. Domain route tests
2. API key tests  
3. Chat/conversation tests
4. Service tests

## Investigation Log

### 1. Checking for auth imports and references

## Key Findings

1. **Most tests already updated**: Many test files have "Phase 1: Auth removed" comments and have been updated
2. **Main issue found**: Some test files in the `test/` directory still have auth imports and mock JWT services
3. **Function signature change**: `createConversationRoutes()` no longer takes any parameters (used to take jwtService and userRepository)

## Files That Need Fixing

### In test/unit/routes/edge/conversation-routes.test.ts:
- Still imports IJwtService from deleted file
- Creates mockJwtService 
- Passes mockJwtService to createConversationRoutes() which no longer accepts parameters

### Pattern of fixes needed:
1. Remove auth-related imports
2. Remove mockJwtService creation
3. Update createConversationRoutes() calls to have no parameters
4. Remove any auth header expectations in tests

## Fixed Files

Successfully fixed 3 test files:
1. `/test/unit/routes/edge/conversation-routes.test.ts`
2. `/test/unit/routes/edge/conversation-routes-edge-cases.test.ts`
3. `/test/integration/routes/edge/conversation-validation-flow.test.ts`

### Changes Made:
- Removed imports of IJwtService and IUserRepository from deleted auth files
- Removed mockJwtService and mockUserRepository variable declarations
- Removed mock service creation code in beforeEach blocks
- Updated createConversationRoutes() calls to have no parameters (was passing mockJwtService and mockUserRepository)

## Final Results
✓ All 57 test suites pass
✓ All 593 tests pass
✓ No references to deleted auth modules remain
✓ Only legitimate uses of "token" (in metadata fields) remain

### Test Coverage (Meets Project Standards)
- **Domain Services**: 96.56% (required: 90%) ✓
- **Edge Routes**: 89.93% (required: 75%) ✓
- **Overall Project**: High coverage maintained

## Summary
The auth removal was mostly complete in the src/ directory tests, with only test files in the test/ directory needing updates. The main issue was that createConversationRoutes() function signature changed from accepting (jwtService, userRepository) to accepting no parameters.

All tests are now passing and coverage requirements are met.
