# Claude 3.7 Sonnet Integration Notes

## Current Status

The Claude 3.7 Sonnet model has been added to the AnthropicService with the following configuration:

```typescript
'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250218': {
  id: 'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250218',
  name: 'Claude 3.7 Sonnet',
  maxTokens: 4096,
  contextWindow: 200000,
  supportsStreaming: true,
  pricingPerInputToken: 0.000003,
  pricingPerOutputToken: 0.000015
}
```

## Implementation Details

1. **Model Added** - Claude 3.7 Sonnet has been added to the AnthropicService.ts file
2. **Default Model** - Set as the DEFAULT_MODEL_ID
3. **API Key** - Required for testing, should be set in the .env file

## Testing

A standalone test script `claude37-test.js` has been created to test the integration directly without involving the full server. To run it:

1. Add your Anthropic API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```
   node claude37-test.js
   ```

## TypeScript Issues

The project currently has TypeScript compilation issues that prevent the full server from starting:

1. JWT Service type issue with `expiresIn` property
2. Mock Anthropic Service import errors for various types
3. OpenAPI YAML duplicate endpoint issue (fixed)

## Next Steps

1. Fix the TypeScript compilation errors, focusing on the JWT service first
2. Ensure the streaming implementation works correctly with the Anthropic SDK
3. Test the integration with the full server
4. Add proper error handling and mapping for Anthropic API errors
