# Liminal Type Chat - Development Journal for Milestone 0003

## SQLite Database Connectivity & Health Check Implementation

Date: 2025-05-11

### Summary

Successfully implemented SQLite database connectivity and health check features for the Liminal Type Chat application as part of Milestone 0003. The implementation follows the project's tiered architecture approach and adheres to Test-Driven Development principles.

### What Was Accomplished

1. Implemented SQLite database connectivity using `better-sqlite3`
2. Created a lightweight `DatabaseProvider` interface
3. Developed the `SQLiteProvider` class implementing the database interface
4. Added health check table and schema initialization logic
5. Extended the `HealthService` to include database connection checks
6. Created a database health check endpoint (`/api/v1/domain/health/db`)
7. Developed a visual dashboard for health endpoint testing

### Key Components Added

1. **Database Provider Interface**
   - Created a lightweight `DatabaseProvider` interface to define common database operations
   - Located at: `server/src/providers/db/database-provider.ts`
   - Includes methods for query, exec, transaction, and health check
   - Decision: Used an interface pattern instead of direct database calls to maintain separation of concerns
   - Rationale: Makes the code more testable and allows for easy swapping of database implementations

2. **SQLite Provider Implementation**
   - Implemented `SQLiteProvider` class wrapping better-sqlite3
   - Located at: `server/src/providers/db/sqlite-provider.ts`
   - Features:
     - Database initialization with schema creation
     - Query execution with typed results
     - Transaction support with rollback
     - Error handling with DatabaseError class
     - Health check functionality
   - Decision: Used SQLite with better-sqlite3 rather than a full ORM solution
   - Rationale: Lightweight, no external dependencies, perfect for this scale of application
   - Tradeoff: Less abstraction than with an ORM, but more direct control over queries

3. **Health Check Table**
   - Automatically creates a `health_checks` table during initialization
   - Schema includes check type, status, and timestamp
   - Records database health checks for monitoring
   - Decision: Created a dedicated table for health check records
   - Rationale: Allows for historical tracking of system health and potential alerting in the future
   - Learning: Keeping track of health checks provides valuable system insights

4. **Enhanced Health Service**
   - Extended `HealthService` to include database health checks
   - Located at: `server/src/services/core/health-service.ts`
   - Added methods for checking database connection status

5. **Database Health Endpoint**
   - Added `/api/v1/domain/health/db` endpoint
   - Located at: `server/src/routes/domain/health.ts`
   - Returns detailed database connection status

6. **Visual Health Dashboard**
   - Added a simple HTML interface for testing health endpoints
   - Located in root route (`/`) at `server/src/app.ts`
   - Features system and database health check buttons
   - Uses iframes to display JSON responses

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Database Initialization**
   - Challenge: Ensuring the database initializes correctly at startup
   - Solution: Created an async initialization process that runs on application start
   - Learning: Graceful handling of database setup is crucial for reliability

2. **Error Handling**
   - Challenge: Consistent error handling across database operations
   - Solution: Created a custom `DatabaseError` class extending the application's error system
   - Learning: Proper domain-specific error types improve debugging and user feedback

3. **Testing Database Operations**
   - Challenge: Testing database operations without affecting the real database
   - Solution: Created in-memory SQLite database for tests
   - Learning: In-memory databases significantly speed up test execution

### Code Evolution

1. **Initial Implementation**
   - Started with direct database calls in services
   - Evolved to a provider pattern for better separation of concerns

2. **Error Handling Evolution**
   - Started with simple try/catch blocks
   - Evolved to comprehensive error system with consistent codes and messages

3. **Transaction Support**
   - Added transaction support for operations requiring multiple statements
   - Enabled rollback capabilities for data integrity

### Test Coverage

- Comprehensive unit tests for the SQLite provider
- Enhanced health service tests covering all edge cases
- Integration tests for database health endpoint
- All tests pass with 100% coverage for domain services

### Running the Application

The server will automatically:
1. Find an available port starting from 9000
2. Initialize the SQLite database in the `server/db` directory
3. Create necessary tables if they don't exist
4. Start the web server with the health dashboard

### Next Steps

- Implement domain client adapter pattern for tier communication
- Create edge routes that use the domain client to access domain services
- Add support for both direct and HTTP communication modes
- Implement comprehensive test suite for both communication modes
