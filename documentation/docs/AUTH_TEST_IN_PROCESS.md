# Authentication Bridge Testing in Progress

This document tracks our ongoing manual testing of the Edge-Domain Authentication Bridge implemented in Phase 3 of Milestone 0009.

## Test 1: Edge Authentication Flow

### Steps Completed:

1. **Navigate to the application**
   - Opened browser to http://localhost:5173
   - Observed the health page and dashboards
   - Header contains: "Liminal Type Chat", "Health Dashboard", "Chat", "Auth Tester", "API Docs"

2. **Access authentication testing component**
   - Clicked on "Auth Tester" in the header
   - Successfully navigated to the Auth Tester page

3. **Initiate GitHub OAuth flow**
   - Found and clicked "Start Github Authentication" button
   - A quick flash occurred (likely the GitHub redirect and immediate return)
   - System displayed:
     - "Step 2: Exchange Code for Token"
     - Code value: 921176e47787f351a703
     - State value: 65b2f5f2-b009-48cd-aff9-e91999750a5c
     - PKCE Enabled: true
   - This confirms the OAuth flow started with PKCE protection

4. **Complete authentication process**
   - Clicked "Exchange Token for Code" button
   - Error occurred in UI rendering (React error about invalid child objects)
   - Page displayed blank screen

5. **Verify authentication state**
   - Checked Local Storage to confirm authentication data:
     - `auth_pkce_enabled`: true
     - `auth_state`: 65b2f5f2-b009-48cd-aff9-e91999750a5c
     - `liminal_auth_token`: dev.token.forTestingOnly
   - Token appears to be a development placeholder rather than a real JWT

6. **Test access to protected routes**
   - Successfully navigated to "Chat" section
   - Able to access the protected route, suggesting authentication is working

7. **Test API interactions**
   - Sent a message "Good morning Claude" in the chat interface
   - Observed network request to:
     ```
     http://localhost:8765/api/v1/chat/completions/stream?threadId=ab0916f5-93e6-486d-9450-7b09628d8cad&provider=anthropic&modelId=claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219&prompt=Good+morning+Claude&placeholderId=assistant-1747571443870-e2t98mc6fzf&_t=1747571443870
     ```
   - This is an edge API endpoint, not a domain endpoint
   - No "Authorization" header was present in the request
   - Found header `x-dev-auth-bypass: true` indicating authentication is being bypassed for development

### Findings So Far:

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - GitHub OAuth with PKCE is implemented
   - The flow appears to execute quickly, suggesting proper implementation
   - The Auth Tester component has a display issue after authentication

2. **Token Handling**:
   - A development token is being used instead of a real JWT
   - The application is in development mode with authentication bypasses enabled

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - The `x-dev-auth-bypass` header suggests environment-aware security is working
   - PKCE protection is correctly enabled for the OAuth flow
   - The application differentiates between development and production environments

### Remaining Tests:

1. **Edge to Domain Token Exchange**:
   - We need to find endpoints that access domain services
   - Verify whether these requests use different tokens than edge endpoints
   - Check if domain tokens have the correct scopes and claims

2. **Security Headers**:
   - Examine response headers on different endpoints
   - Verify presence of security headers like CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
   - Confirm headers are appropriate for the development environment

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Test authentication with invalid tokens
   - Verify proper error messages and handling
   - Check behavior when tokens expire

4. **Environment-based Security**:
   - Confirm security levels are appropriate for development environment
   - Test whether security bypasses only work in development mode

## Next Steps

When testing resumes, we should:

1. Find and test domain-specific endpoints to verify token exchange
2. Check for proper authentication error handling
3. Verify security headers on server responses
4. Test environment-specific security behavior

## Issues to Address

1. **UI Error in Auth Tester**:
   - After completing authentication, the Auth Tester component shows an error
   - React error: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {})"
   - This should be investigated and fixed

2. **Development Mode**:
   - The application appears to be in development mode with authentication bypasses
   - For proper testing, we may need to configure the environment to more closely reflect production settings

## Additional Notes

- The browser appears to handle GitHub authentication very quickly, suggesting the user may already be logged into GitHub
- The development token in localStorage suggests we're not getting a real token from the authentication flow
- The `x-dev-auth-bypass` header confirms the application is correctly identifying its environment
