# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Liminal Type Chat
### *Welcome to the Threshold*

**Version:** 1.0 - Draft  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Status:** In Review

## TODO: Document Review Needed
This PRD needs review and refinement in the following areas:
- [ ] **Tone down hyped ideals** - Some sections are overly aspirational
- [ ] **Refine use cases** - Remove or consolidate some of the more speculative use cases
- [ ] **Update success metrics** - Current metrics are too basic/generic KPIs
- [ ] **Move technical details** - Some technical implementation details should be in TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] **Fix timelines and milestones** - Current timeline doesn't align with actual development progress

## Executive Summary

Liminal Type Chat is the flagship application of the Liminal Type Platform - an open-source foundation for transformative human-AI collaboration. At its core, it's a local-first chat application where users bring their own API keys. But its true innovation lies in enabling AI Roundtable conversations where multiple AI perspectives collaborate with humans to transform ideas into reality.

**Liminal** (adj.): *Occupying a position at, or on both sides of, a boundary or threshold*

We exist at the threshold between human creativity and AI capability, creating spaces where transformation happens.

## Product Vision

### Vision Statement
To build the foundational platform where human creativity and AI intelligence meet, collaborate, and transform ideas into reality. We're creating the infrastructure for a new kind of human-AI partnership - one based on collective intelligence, multiple perspectives, and the transformative power of dialogue at the threshold of possibility.

### Key Differentiators
1. **AI Roundtable Conversations**: The only platform where multiple AI perspectives collaborate in real dialogue, not just sequential responses
2. **Liminal Space Design**: Purpose-built for the threshold moments where ideas transform into reality
3. **Platform, Not Just Chat**: Extensible foundation for specialized AI-augmented workflows (music, writing, coding, decision-making)
4. **True Local-First**: Your ideas, your data, your API keys - no middleman, no surveillance, no platform lock-in
5. **Collective Intelligence**: Harness the wisdom of multiple AI perspectives working together, not just switching between them
6. **Open Source Foundation**: Join a community building the future of human-AI collaboration

## The Liminal Philosophy *(Needs Review: Tone Down)*

### Why "Liminal"?

In anthropology, liminal spaces are where transformation happens - the space between what was and what will be. The Liminal Type Platform creates that transformative space for:

- **Ideas**: Raw thoughts â†’ Refined concepts through multi-perspective dialogue
- **Creativity**: Initial sparks â†’ Fully realized works with AI collaboration
- **Decisions**: Uncertainty â†’ Clarity through collective intelligence
- **Projects**: Conception â†’ Completion with your AI roundtable

### The Roundtable Metaphor

Traditional AI interactions are linear: Human â†’ AI â†’ Response. The Liminal approach is circular, collaborative, and multi-dimensional. 

Imagine sitting at a roundtable where:
- **You** bring vision, creativity, and judgment
- **Multiple AI perspectives** bring different expertise and viewpoints  
- **The conversation** flows naturally between participants
- **Ideas evolve** through collective intelligence

This isn't about AI replacing human thought - it's about augmenting human creativity through structured dialogue with multiple specialized intelligences.

Architect (Claude): Here's a JWT-based design...
You: @SecurityExpert review this for vulnerabilities
SecurityExpert (GPT-4): I see three concerns...
You: @both what about rate limiting?
```

- Q3: Additional LLM providers (Gemini, open-source models)
- Q4: Advanced orchestration features
- Q4: Smart routing and pattern learning

## Open Questions

1. **AI Panel Implementation**: 
   - Should panelist responses appear in columns, threads, or sequential?
   - How do we handle context when some panelists join mid-conversation?
   - Should we offer pre-built panel templates (e.g., "Code Review Panel", "Decision Making Panel")?
   - How much conversation history does each panelist need to see?

2. **Deployment Strategy**: Should we prioritize Docker containers or native installers?
3. **Cloud Features**: What cloud-optional features would users value most?
4. **Monetization**: Should we offer a hosted version for non-technical users?
5. **Community**: How do we best foster an active contributor community?
