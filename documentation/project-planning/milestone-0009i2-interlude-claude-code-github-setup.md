# Milestone 0009i2: Claude Code GitHub Repository Setup

**Status**: Planning  
**Type**: Interlude (Non-feature work between milestones)  
**Created**: January 2025

## Overview

This interlude milestone captures the work to properly set up the GitHub repository for Claude Code development, ensuring commits and collaboration work smoothly with AI-assisted development.

## Objectives

1. **GitHub Repository Configuration** - Basic setup for Claude Code commits
2. **Git Configuration** - Ensure proper author attribution for AI-assisted commits
3. **Repository Access** - Verify Claude Code can push to the repository
4. **Commit Standards** - Establish conventions for AI-generated commits

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Repository Setup
- [ ] Verify repository is properly cloned locally
- [ ] Ensure GitHub remote is configured correctly
- [ ] Check push access with Claude Code credentials
- [ ] Verify main branch is set as default

### 2. Git Configuration for Claude Code
- [ ] Configure git co-author for AI-assisted commits:
  ```bash
  # Claude Code automatically adds co-author to commits:
  # Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```
- [ ] Verify commit signatures include Claude Code marker:
  ```
  ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
  ```
- [ ] Test commit and push workflow

### 3. Basic Commit Standards

#### Commit Message Format
```
type: description

Optional body explaining changes

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

#### Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 4. Repository Access Verification
- [ ] Test creating a branch
- [ ] Test committing changes
- [ ] Test pushing to remote
- [ ] Verify commits appear correctly on GitHub
- [ ] Check co-author attribution is working

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Local Repository Check
```bash
# Verify git remote
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin  https://github.com/[username]/liminal-type-chat.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/[username]/liminal-type-chat.git (push)
```

### Step 2: Test Claude Code Commits
1. Make a small change (e.g., update README)
2. Let Claude Code commit with its standard format
3. Push to a test branch
4. Verify on GitHub that:
   - Commit appears correctly
   - Co-author attribution shows
   - Claude Code marker is visible

### Step 3: Establish Working Pattern
- Always work on feature branches
- Use descriptive branch names
- Follow commit message conventions
- Create PRs as outlined in interlude 0009i1

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Repository properly configured for Claude Code
- [ ] Commits show proper attribution
- [ ] Push/pull workflow functioning
- [ ] Commit message format established
- [ ] Basic workflow documented in CLAUDE.md

## Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure GitHub credentials are configured
   - Check SSH keys or HTTPS tokens

2. **Push Rejected**
   - Work on feature branches, not main
   - Pull latest changes before pushing

3. **Commit Attribution**
   - Claude Code automatically adds co-author
   - No manual configuration needed

## Next Steps

After this setup:
1. Begin using established workflow
2. Create PRs following standards from interlude 0009i1
3. Build experience with AI-assisted development
4. Document learnings for future team members
