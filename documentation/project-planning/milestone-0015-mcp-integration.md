# Milestone 0015: MCP Integration

## Status: Not Started

## Objective
Integrate Model Control Protocol (MCP) capabilities for tool-based AI interactions, enabling LLMs to execute actions and access external resources through a secure, structured interface.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. MCP Server Implementation
- Implement MCP server compatible with Anthropic's protocol specification
- Handle tool registration, discovery, and metadata management
- Support async tool execution with proper error handling
- Implement request/response lifecycle management

### 2. Tool Registration System
- Dynamic tool registration interface
- Tool metadata schema (name, description, parameters, returns)
- Tool versioning and deprecation support
- Runtime tool availability checks

### 3. Tool Execution Framework
- Secure sandboxed execution environment
- Parameter validation and type checking
- Result formatting and error propagation
- Execution timeout and resource limits
- Audit logging for all tool invocations

### 4. Security Boundaries
- Tool permission system (read/write/execute)
- User-based tool access control
- Rate limiting per tool and per user
- Input sanitization and output filtering
- Prevent privilege escalation through tool chaining

### 5. LLM Provider Integration
- Extend existing LLM providers to support tool calls
- Tool selection and routing logic
- Response streaming with tool execution results
- Fallback handling for unsupported tools

## Success Criteria
- [ ] MCP server successfully registers and exposes tools
- [ ] Tools can be discovered and invoked by LLM providers
- [ ] Security boundaries prevent unauthorized tool access
- [ ] Tool execution is audited and rate-limited
- [ ] Integration works with both Anthropic and OpenAI providers
- [ ] Performance impact < 100ms overhead per tool call
- [ ] 90% test coverage for security-critical paths

## Dependencies
- **Milestone 0008**: LLM Integration (completed) - Base LLM provider architecture
- **Milestone 0009**: Security Hardening (completed) - Security patterns and audit framework
- **Milestone 0010**: Streaming Architecture (completed) - SSE infrastructure for tool results
- **Milestone 0011**: Chat Interface Refinement (in progress) - UI for tool interactions
- **Milestone 0012**: OpenAPI Integration (planned) - API documentation for MCP endpoints

## Technical Approach
1. Implement MCP server as Edge tier service
2. Tools execute at Edge tier with Domain tier audit logging
3. Use existing streaming infrastructure for real-time tool results
4. Leverage security provider for access control and encryption
5. Extend LLM provider interface to support tool specifications

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Tool execution could expose system vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Strict sandboxing, input validation, and audit trails
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with complex tool chains
  - **Mitigation**: Execution timeouts, resource limits, and caching
- **Risk**: Compatibility issues with different LLM providers
  - **Mitigation**: Provider-agnostic tool interface with adapters

## Notes
Originally planned as Milestone 0014, this was re-prioritized after auth removal (Milestone 0014) to focus on core AI features first. The MCP integration builds upon the completed security and streaming infrastructure to provide a robust tool execution environment.
