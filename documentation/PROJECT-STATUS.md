Implementation of both edge and domain routes for health checks using the edge-to-domain adapter pattern. This milestone established key architectural patterns for API routing.

**Status**: Complete | **Development Journal**: [Dev Journal 0004](./dev-journal/dev-journal-0004.md)

### ✅ [Milestone 0005: React TypeScript Frontend with Health Check Features](./project-planning/milestone-0005-react-typescript-frontend.md)

Creation of a modern React TypeScript frontend with build deployment to the Express server and integration with the health check API endpoints. This milestone completed the initial full-stack implementation.

**Status**: Complete | **Development Journal**: [Dev Journal 0005](./dev-journal/dev-journal-0005.md)

## MVP B Milestones

### ✅ [Milestone 0006: Core ContextThread Domain Layer](./project-planning/milestone-0006-domain-layer-v2.md)

Implementation of core domain logic for managing ContextThreads and Messages, including data models, persistence, and domain services. This milestone established the foundation for the chat functionality.

**Status**: Complete | **Development Journal**: [Dev Journal 0006](./dev-journal/dev-journal-0006.md)

### ✅ [Milestone 0007: Edge Tier API for ContextThreads](./project-planning/milestone-0007-edge-api.md)

Exposure of the ContextThread domain functionality via a RESTful API in the Edge Tier, including OpenAPI specification and Swagger UI for testing. This milestone connected the domain logic to the frontend.

**Status**: Complete | **Development Journal**: [Dev Journal 0007](./dev-journal/dev-journal-0007.md)

### ✅ [Milestone 0008: LLM Integration](./project-planning/milestone-0008-llm-integration.md)

Integration of LLM providers (Claude) into the application, enabling AI-powered chat functionality. This milestone added the core AI capabilities to the application.

**Status**: Complete | **Development Journal**: [Dev Journal 0008](./dev-journal/dev-journal-0008.md)

### ✅ [Milestone 0009: Security Hardening](./project-planning/milestone-0009-security-hardening.md)

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and other security features to protect user data and API access. Authentication was extensively implemented and tested with WorkOS/OAuth, but ultimately removed in favor of a simplified cookie-based approach. Phase 1 of the simplification (complete auth removal) has been implemented.

**Status**: Complete | **Development Journal**: [Dev Journal 0009](./dev-journal/dev-journal-0009.md)

## Re-Prioritization Note

After Milestone 0009, a strategic re-prioritization occurred to accelerate core platform capabilities. The original sequence (Streaming → Chat UI → OpenAPI → MCP) was reorganized to prioritize LLM provider support and the AI Roundtable feature, which represents the unique value proposition of the platform. This decision was driven by:

1. **Market Differentiation**: The AI Roundtable feature (multi-model conversations with @mentions) is the core innovation
2. **Technical Dependencies**: Multi-provider support is prerequisite for the roundtable feature
3. **User Value**: Earlier delivery of the platform's unique capabilities provides more immediate value
4. **Architectural Clarity**: Provider abstraction work informs streaming and UI decisions

## Future Milestones

### 🔄 [Milestone 0010: Streaming Hardening](./project-planning/milestone-0010-streaming-hardening.md)

Improvement of streaming capabilities, optimizing performance, handling edge cases, and ensuring reliable delivery of AI responses. This remains the current priority to ensure a solid foundation for multi-provider support.

**Status**: In Progress | **Development Journal**: *In progress*

### ⏳ [Milestone 0011: OpenAI Provider Implementation](./project-planning/milestone-0011-openai-provider.md)

Implementation of OpenAI as a second LLM provider, establishing the provider abstraction pattern and laying groundwork for multi-provider support.

**Status**: Planning | **Development Journal**: *Not yet started*

### ⏳ [Milestone 0012: Multi-Provider Support](./project-planning/milestone-0012-multi-provider-support.md)

Full implementation of provider abstraction layer, enabling seamless switching between LLM providers and setting up infrastructure for concurrent provider usage.

**Status**: Not Started | **Development Journal**: *Not yet started*

### ⏳ [Milestone 0013: AI Roundtable MVP](./project-planning/milestone-0013-ai-roundtable-mvp.md)

Implementation of the core AI Roundtable feature, enabling multi-model conversations with @mention-based provider selection. This represents the platform's unique value proposition.

**Status**: Not Started | **Development Journal**: *Not yet started*

### ⏳ [Milestone 0014: Chat Interface Refinement](./project-planning/milestone-0014-chat-interface-refinement.md)

Comprehensive refinement of the chat interface to support roundtable conversations, including UI/UX improvements, message threading, and provider indicators.

**Status**: Not Started | **Development Journal**: *Not yet started*

### ⏳ [Milestone 0015: MCP Integration](./project-planning/milestone-0015-mcp-integration.md)

Integration of Model Control Protocol (MCP) capabilities, enabling advanced AI interactions and tool-based features within the roundtable context.

**Status**: Not Started | **Development Journal**: *Not yet started*

### ⏳ [Milestone 0016: OpenAPI Full Implementation](./project-planning/milestone-0016-openapi-integration.md)

Comprehensive OpenAPI specification for all endpoints, enabling better API documentation, client generation, and testing of the complete platform API.

**Status**: Not Started | **Development Journal**: *Not yet started*

> **Note**: The re-prioritized sequence accelerates delivery of the AI Roundtable feature, which is the platform's core differentiator
