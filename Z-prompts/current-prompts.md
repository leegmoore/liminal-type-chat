## Milestone till done
please continue with @project-planning/milestone-0009-security-hardening.md phase 3 until it's objectives and it's definition of done is fully met. Review the definitions of done. Think hard about the definition of done. Remember those definitions. 1. ALL tests must pass (server AND client) 2. ALL code coverage thresholds must be met (server AND client) 3. ALL linting checks must pass (server AND client) 4. ALL Code must build successfully (server AND client) 5. Applications must start without errors (server AND client) 6. Required manual testing must be performed and pass 7. When AI agents have finished confirming all Lint, test, build, server starts, client starts pass, then setup whatever you can to prepare user to test. Link any pages and provide detailed instructions for the user to engage in the test. Then and only then is phase 3 complete
