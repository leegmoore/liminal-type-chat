# Next Steps for Claude 3.7 Sonnet Integration

We've made significant improvements to the code to enable Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration despite dependency issues. Follow these steps to complete the setup and testing process:

## Step 1: Run the Super Minimal Server

The dependency issues with Express and other packages make it difficult to run the original server. Instead, use our super minimal server that has NO dependencies:

```bash
# Start the super minimal server
cd server
node super-minimal-server.js

# Or use the troubleshooting script which will automatically find the right server to use
chmod +x ../troubleshoot-server.sh
../troubleshoot-server.sh
```

This server provides mock responses for health checks, API keys, models, and basic conversation management - enough to test the client integration.

## Step 2: Verify Environment Setup

Check that your environment is properly configured:

1. Ensure you have a `.env.local` file in the server directory with the following:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=8765
   JWT_SECRET=development_secret_key_for_testing_only
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=30m
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=development_encryption_key_for_testing_only
   BYPASS_AUTH=true
   ```

2. Our code has authentication bypass and JWT fixes applied by default

## Step 3: Test Client Integration

In a separate terminal:

```bash
# Start the client application
cd client
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173/chat in your browser to test the client integration. The following improvements have been made:

1. Automatic guest login for development testing
2. Authentication bypass on the server side 
3. Fixed JWT token type issues
4. Claude 3.7 Sonnet highlighted as the recommended model

The client should automatically log in as a guest and connect to the super minimal server. While actual API calls won't work, you can see the UI and interaction flow.

## Long-term Solution for Dependency Issues

To fix the underlying dependency issues permanently:

1. **Network Issues**: Try connecting through a different network (e.g., mobile hotspot) to avoid SSL certificate problems

2. **Manual Package Installation**: Install critical packages manually:
   ```bash
   npm install body-parser cors express jsonwebtoken uuid dotenv
   ```

3. **Package Cache Clearing**:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   npm ci  # Clean install from package-lock.json
   ```

4. **Node Version**: Ensure you're using Node.js version 18 or 20:
   ```bash
   nvm use 18  # if you have nvm installed
   # or
   node -v  # to check your version
   ```

## Authentication Details

For testing, we've implemented:

1. **Authentication Bypass**: The server will accept requests without JWT tokens when `BYPASS_AUTH=true`
2. **Guest Login**: The client now supports automatic guest login in development mode
3. **JWT Type Fix**: Fixed type issues with JWT token expiration

These changes allow you to test Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration without needing to implement full authentication.

## Troubleshooting

If the super minimal server isn't enough for your needs, you may need to fix the dependency issues directly. Common problems include:

1. SSL certificate issues - often fixed by changing networks
2. Missing dependencies in node_modules - solved with npm cache cleaning
3. Node version mismatches - check you're using Node 18 or 20
4. Package-lock.json issues - try deleting it and running npm install again

Remember that the super minimal server is just for testing the UI and interaction flow. For full functionality, you'll need to resolve the underlying dependency issues.
