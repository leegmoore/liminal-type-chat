# Introduction to Liminal Type Chat

Liminal Type Chat is an open-source, local-first GenAI chat application designed for individuals and small teams who want to leverage their own API keys to interact with various language models (LLMs). It prioritizes user control, data privacy, and flexibility. The project uses a tiered architecture and a monorepo structure to facilitate clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.
