# MVP 1 Milestones (Completed)

## Milestone 0001 (was M0): Project Initialization & First Commit

- **Objective**: Set up the basic Node.js/TypeScript project structure, configuration files, initialize a Git repository, and perform the initial commit. This establishes the foundational codebase.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  1.  **Directory Structure**: Create `src/` directory.
  2.  **Configuration Files**: 
      - `package.json` (basic project info, scripts: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `test`; initial dependencies: `express`, `dotenv`; dev dependencies: `typescript`, `@types/express`, `@types/node`, `ts-node`, `nodemon`, `jest`, `@types/jest`, `ts-jest`, `supertest`, `@types/supertest`).
      - `tsconfig.json` (appropriate compiler options).
      - `.gitignore` (common Node.js/TypeScript ignores like `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env`).
  3.  **Git Repository**: Initialize Git repository; first commit with all initial project files.
- **Assumption**: Operating within the existing project root directory.

## Milestone 0002 (was M1): Basic HTTP Server & Domain Health Endpoint

- **Objective**: Stand up the Node.js/Express.js application with our architectural folder structure, implement the domain health check endpoint, and validate with tests.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  1.  **Project Initialization**: 
      - Set up `package.json` for server (Node.js LTS, TypeScript, Express.js, Jest, Supertest)
      - Configure `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation
      - Implement the core directory structure following our architectural pattern
  2.  **HTTP Server (Express.js)**:
      - Create main application entry point (`src/app.ts`, `src/server.ts`)
      - Set up modular routing structure with domain routes
      - Configure basic middleware (logging, error handling, etc.)
  3.  **Domain Health Service**:
      - Implement a simple health service in the domain tier
      - Create service method that returns health status and timestamp
  4.  **Domain Health Endpoint**:
      - Create `/api/v1/domain/health` route in domain routes
      - Return JSON response: `{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "..." }`
  5.  **Testing**:
      - Unit tests for health service
      - Integration test for the domain health endpoint using Supertest
- **Success Criteria**:
  - 90% test coverage for the health service
  - Passing integration test for the domain health endpoint

## Milestone 0003 (was M2): SQLite Database Connectivity & Domain DB Health Endpoint

- **Status**: completed
- **Objective**: Set up SQLite database connectivity with a health check table, implement domain service methods for database health checks, and expose through a domain API endpoint.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  1.  **Database Provider Setup**: 
      - Implement a database provider in the providers tier using `better-sqlite3`
      - Create configuration for connecting to SQLite
      - Set up proper dependency injection for the database provider
  2.  **Schema & Initialization**:
      - Create `schema.sql` with DDL for `health_check_table` (`id`, `status`, `checked_at`) 
      - Add DML for a seed record (`{ status: 'system_ready' }`)
      - Document manual initialization process for developers
  3.  **Domain Service Extension**:
      - Extend the health service with a `checkDbConnection()` method
      - Method should query the `health_check_table` and return status and timestamp
      - Implement proper error handling and connection validation
  4.  **Domain DB Health Endpoint**:
      - Create `/api/v1/domain/health/db` route in domain routes
      - Route should call the service method and return appropriate JSON response
      - Include proper error handling and status codes
  5.  **Testing**:
      - Unit tests for the database provider (with mocking)
      - Unit tests for the health service's database check method
      - Integration test for the domain DB health endpoint using Supertest
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - 90% test coverage for the database provider and extended health service
  - Passing integration test for the domain DB health endpoint
  - Clean separation between the service logic and database implementation

## Milestone 0004 (was M3): Edge-to-Domain Pattern Implementation for Health Checks

- **Status**: completed
- **Objective**: Implement both edge and domain routes for our health checks, with the edge-to-domain adapter pattern, and validate with comprehensive integration tests.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  1.  **Domain API Routes & Services**:
      - `/api/v1/domain/health` endpoint in the domain routes
      - `/api/v1/domain/health/db` endpoint in the domain routes
      - Core health service implementation that the domain routes call
  2.  **Edge-to-Domain Adapter**:
      - Domain client adapter with configurable mode (direct/HTTP)
      - Configuration toggle via environment variable
  3.  **Edge API Routes**:
      - `/api/v1/edge/health` in edge routes using the domain client
      - `/api/v1/edge/health/db` in edge routes using the domain client
  4.  **Comprehensive Testing**:
      - Unit tests for the domain client adapter (testing both modes)
      - Integration tests for domain routes (`/api/v1/domain/health` and `/api/v1/domain/health/db`)
      - Integration tests for edge routes (`/api/v1/edge/health` and `/api/v1/edge/health/db`)
      - End-to-end test that verifies the entire flow with the adapter in HTTP mode
- **Success Criteria**:
  - 90% test coverage for the domain client adapter
  - All integration tests passing in both direct and HTTP modes
  - Configuration change (environment variable) successfully toggles adapter behavior without code changes

## Milestone 0005 (was M4): React TypeScript Frontend with Health Check Features

- **Status**: completed
- **Objective**: Create a modern React TypeScript frontend with build deployment to the Express server, comprehensive testing, and health check functionality.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  1.  **React Application Setup**:
      - Initialize React app with TypeScript support
      - Configure appropriate linting and formatting
      - Create base application structure with routing
  2.  **Build & Deployment**:
      - Configure build process to output to a `build` directory
      - Create npm script to copy built assets to the server's `/public` folder
      - Add deployment documentation
  3.  **Testing Infrastructure**:
      - Set up Jest with React Testing Library
      - Configure test coverage reporting with 90% threshold
      - Add test helpers and utilities
  4.  **Health Check Interface**:
      - Create responsive UI with a clean, modern design
      - Implement health check page with two buttons:
        - Server health check button (calls `/api/v1/edge/health`)
        - Database health check button (calls `/api/v1/edge/health/db`)
      - Display results with appropriate visual feedback (success/error states)
      - Add loading states during API calls
  5.  **Component Tests**:
      - Unit tests for all components
      - Integration tests for health check API interactions
      - Mock API responses for predictable testing
- **Success Criteria**:
  - 90% test coverage across the React codebase
  - Successful build and deployment to Express server's public directory
  - Health check buttons correctly call their respective endpoints and display results
  - Responsive design works on various screen sizes
