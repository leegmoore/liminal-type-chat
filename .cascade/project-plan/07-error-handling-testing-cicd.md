# Error Handling Strategy

A standardized, hierarchical error code system is used across the application (backend and frontend). Errors are categorized (e.g., Configuration, Database, API, Validation) with specific codes for precise identification. API responses use consistent JSON formats for errors, including the code, message, and relevant HTTP status. Refer to `docs/ERROR_CODES.md` for the complete list and details.

# Testing Strategy

Testing is a core part of the development process. The strategy includes:

- **Unit Tests:** Jest for backend (Domain, Edge components), Vitest for frontend (React components, utilities).
- **Integration Tests:** Supertest for API endpoint testing, ensuring correct interaction between Edge and Domain tiers.
- **Coverage:** Aiming for high test coverage (e.g., >80% initially) enforced via testing configurations. Refer to `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` for detailed testing guidelines.

## Automated Testing Summary

- **Layers:** Unit tests (Jest/Vitest), Integration tests (for API endpoints and service-to-DB interactions).
- **Tooling:** Jest/Vitest, Supertest for API integration tests.
- **E2E:** Future consideration if a significant UI is developed.

# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

A CI pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions. It automatically runs linters, tests (backend and frontend), and builds upon commits and pull requests to the main branches, ensuring code quality and integration stability.
