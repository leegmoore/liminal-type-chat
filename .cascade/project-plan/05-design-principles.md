# Design Principles and Objectives

The architecture of Liminal Type Chat follows these core principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Domain logic is isolated from UI and API concerns
   - Data access is abstracted from business logic
   - Service responsibilities are clearly defined and focused

2. **Flexibility in Deployment**
   - Application can run as a single process for simplicity
   - Components are designed to be distributable across processes if needed
   - Process boundaries do not dictate code organization
   - Optimized for speed and efficiency at small scales

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start simple with SQLite for local persistence
   - Design allows for future migration to more robust databases
   - Document storage can evolve from local files to cloud storage

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear patterns make the system easier to understand and extend
   - Consistent naming conventions across the codebase
   - Testability is built into the architecture
   - Easy setup with minimal configuration

5. **User Privacy and Control**
   - Local-first approach keeps data under user control
   - Comprehensive BYOK (Bring-Your-Own-Key) model for all LLM services
   - Transparency in how data is stored and accessed
   - User owns all their data and conversation history

6. **Advanced LLM Orchestration**
   - Architecture supports routing one prompt to multiple LLMs
   - Enables chaining LLM outputs as inputs to other LLMs
   - Pre and post-processing hooks for LLM interactions
   - Support for Model Control Protocol (MCP) tooling and function calling

7. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Extensible design with well-defined extension points
   - Ability to add new LLM providers without changing core code
   - Support for custom pre/post processing hooks
   - Framework for custom tools and capabilities

8. **Open Source Readiness**
   - Well-documented code and architecture
   - Clean separation of concerns to encourage contribution
   - Modular design allows for extensibility

9. **Testing as a First-Class Concern**
   - Services designed for testability via dependency injection
   - Clear interfaces between components enable effective mocking
   - High test coverage requirements for critical paths

10. **Testability:** Design components for easy unit and integration testing. Comprehensive test coverage is a primary goal (see Testing Strategy).
11. **Developer Experience:** Prioritize clear documentation, consistent standards, and efficient tooling.
12. **Extensibility:** Design with future enhancements in mind (e.g., plugin systems, multi-database support).
