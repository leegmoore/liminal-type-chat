# Milestone 1 Development Journal - ✅ COMPLETED

This document tracks implementation decisions, problem-solving approaches, and developer notes for Milestone 1 (Basic HTTP Server & Domain Health Endpoint).

## Milestone 1 Objectives - ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Stand up the Node.js/Express.js application with our architectural folder structure
- ✅ Implement the domain health check endpoint
- ✅ Validate with comprehensive tests
- ✅ Implement standardized error handling system

## Implementation Notes

### Error Handling Approach

#### Standardized Error Code System
We've implemented a comprehensive error handling system with hierarchical error codes:

1. **Hierarchical Categorization**: Error codes are grouped by thousands (1000-1999, 2000-2999, etc.) for different error categories:
   - 1000-1999: System/General Errors
   - 2000-2999: Authentication/Authorization Errors
   - 3000-3999: Validation Errors
   - 4000-4999: Resource Errors
   - 5000-5999: Data Access Errors
   - 6000-6999: External Service Errors
   - 7000-7999: Business Logic Errors

2. **One-to-Many HTTP Status Mapping**: Each error code maps to exactly one HTTP status code, but multiple error codes can map to the same HTTP status. This allows for more granular error reporting while maintaining HTTP standard compliance.

3. **Consistent Error Response Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "error": {
       "code": 3000,
       "message": "Validation failed"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Environment-Specific Details**: In non-production environments, additional debugging details are included:
   ```json
   {
     "error": {
       "code": 3000,
       "message": "Validation failed",
       "details": "Detailed error information",
       "errorCode": "VALIDATION_FAILED"
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Validation Error Collections**: Support for field-specific validation errors:
   ```json
   {
     "error": {
       "code": 3000,
       "message": "Validation failed",
       "items": [
         { "field": "email", "code": 3030, "message": "Invalid format" }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

#### Implementation Components
- Type-safe error classes with appropriate status codes
- Consistent error response format
- Full documentation of error codes in `/docs/ERROR_CODES.md`
- Error middleware that properly formats all responses

### Testing Strategy
- We'll use Jest for unit tests
- Supertest for integration tests
- 90% test coverage for the health service
- Focus on both happy path and edge cases

### Domain Health Service - ✅ COMPLETED
The health service provides:
1. `getSystemStatus()` - Returns basic health data and timestamp ✅
2. (Future) `checkDbConnection()` - Will be added in Milestone 2 when we implement SQLite

## Milestone 1 Completion Summary

Milestone 1 has been successfully completed with all objectives met. The application now has:

1. **Proper Architectural Structure**:
   - Domain tier with the `HealthService` containing the business logic
   - Edge/XPI tier with routes that expose the domain functionality
   - Clean separation between tiers following the project plan

2. **Working Health Endpoint**:
   - `GET /api/v1/domain/health` endpoint that returns system status
   - Response format: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-05-11T16:53:41.651Z"}`
   - Error handling via middleware

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling System**:
   - Hierarchical error codes for different error categories
   - Standardized error response format
   - Environment-aware error information (verbose in development, concise in production)
   - Dedicated error documentation in `/docs/ERROR_CODES.md`

4. **Test Coverage**:
   - Unit tests for the health service
   - Integration tests for the health endpoint
   - 100% test coverage for both components

5. **Project Restructuring for Better Separation**:
   - Reorganized as a monorepo with separate `server` and `client` workspaces
   - Dedicated test directory structure with separation for unit and integration tests
   - Independent configuration files for each workspace
   - Root-level workspace coordination for scripts and TypeScript project references
   - Placeholder structure for the React frontend implementation in Milestone 4

The application is now ready for Milestone 2, which will focus on core data models and database setup.
