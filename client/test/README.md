# Client Tests

This directory will contain tests for the client codebase once it is implemented during Milestone 4.

## Planned Test Organization

- Unit tests for React components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete user flows

## Test Coverage Requirements

As outlined in our development standards, the client code will maintain:
- 80% minimum coverage for UI components
- 90% minimum coverage for utility functions
- 80% minimum coverage for state management

Tests will be implemented alongside the client implementation in Milestone 4.
