# Liminal Type Chat - Milestone 2 Completion

## SQLite Database Connectivity & Health Check Implementation (Milestone 2)

Date: 2025-05-11

### Summary

Successfully implemented SQLite database connectivity and health check features for the Liminal Type Chat application as part of Milestone 2. The implementation follows the project's tiered architecture approach and adheres to Test-Driven Development principles.

### Key Components Added

1. **Database Provider Interface**
   - Created a lightweight `DatabaseProvider` interface to define common database operations
   - Located at: `server/src/providers/db/database-provider.ts`
   - Includes methods for query, exec, transaction, and health check

2. **SQLite Provider Implementation**
   - Implemented `SQLiteProvider` class wrapping better-sqlite3
   - Located at: `server/src/providers/db/sqlite-provider.ts`
   - Features:
     - Database initialization with schema creation
     - Query execution with typed results
     - Transaction support with rollback
     - Error handling with DatabaseError class
     - Health check functionality

3. **Health Check Table**
   - Automatically creates a `health_checks` table during initialization
   - Schema includes check type, status, and timestamp
   - Records database health checks for monitoring

4. **Enhanced Health Service**
   - Extended `HealthService` to include database health checks
   - Located at: `server/src/services/core/health-service.ts`
   - Added methods for checking database connection status

5. **Database Health Endpoint**
   - Added `/api/v1/domain/health/db` endpoint
   - Located at: `server/src/routes/domain/health.ts`
   - Returns detailed database connection status

6. **Visual Health Dashboard**
   - Added a simple HTML interface for testing health endpoints
   - Located in root route (`/`) at `server/src/app.ts`
   - Features system and database health check buttons
   - Uses iframes to display JSON responses

### Test Coverage

- Comprehensive unit tests for the SQLite provider
- Enhanced health service tests covering all edge cases
- Integration tests for database health endpoint
- All tests pass with 100% coverage for domain services

### Running the Application

The server will automatically:
1. Find an available port starting from 9000
2. Initialize the SQLite database in the `server/db` directory
3. Create necessary tables if they don't exist
4. Start the web server with the health dashboard

### Next Steps (Milestone 3)

- Implement domain client adapter pattern for tier communication
- Create edge routes that use the domain client to access domain services
- Add support for both direct and HTTP communication modes
- Implement comprehensive test suite for both communication modes
