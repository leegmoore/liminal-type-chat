# In-Progress Documentation

This directory contains working documentation that is either:
1. Actively evolving with project development
2. Pending review for potential inclusion in the Wiki or READMEs
3. Historical content preserved for reference

## Directory Structure

- `/dev-journal/` - Development journals remain here permanently as historical logs
- `/evaluations/` - Product and feature evaluations, experiments, and analyses
- `/planning/` - Working plans, milestone details, and design documents
- `/archive/` - Outdated content pending review before wiki migration or removal

## Documentation Lifecycle

Documentation in this directory follows a general lifecycle:
1. Creation as working documents during active development
2. Review during milestone completion or periodic evaluation
3. Either:
   - Migration to GitHub Wiki for stable, reference content
   - Updates to main README files for essential navigation/reference
   - Retention in `/dev-journal/` for historical record
   - Retention in other folders for ongoing work

## Review Process

Periodic reviews will evaluate content in this directory to:
- Identify stable content ready for wiki migration
- Update navigation links in main READMEs
- Archive or remove obsolete content after consultation

**Important**: Do not remove documents from this directory without review and approval.
