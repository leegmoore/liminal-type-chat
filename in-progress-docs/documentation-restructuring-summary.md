# Documentation Restructuring Summary

**Date:** 2025-05-18  
**Status:** Completed  
**Authors:** LLM Chat Team

## Overview

This document summarizes the documentation restructuring effort conducted to improve organization, discoverability, and maintenance of project documentation. The effort established a two-tier documentation structure with clear separation between stable reference material and evolving working documents.

## Key Changes

### Two-Tier Documentation Structure

1. **Wiki (`/wiki/`)**: Stable, curated reference documentation
   - Thoroughly reviewed content
   - Comprehensive coverage of topics
   - Follows standardized templates
   - Organized by domain area

2. **In-Progress Docs (`/in-progress-docs/`)**: Working and historical documentation
   - Development journals and historical records
   - Active planning documents
   - Evaluations and analyses
   - Archived content pending review

### Directory Organization

#### Wiki Structure
- `/wiki/engineering/` - Technical standards and implementation guides
  - `/standards/` - Coding standards, testing, and best practices
  - `/reference/` - Technical reference like error codes
  - `/frontend/` - Frontend architecture and components
  - `/backend/` - Backend architecture and services
  - `/database/` - Database schema and data models
- `/wiki/security/` - Security architecture and implementation 
- `/wiki/project/` - Project roadmap and milestone information
- `/wiki/api/` - API documentation and examples
- `/wiki/guides/` - Developer guides for common tasks

#### In-Progress Structure
- `/in-progress-docs/journals/` - Development journals
- `/in-progress-docs/planning/` - Working plans and designs
- `/in-progress-docs/evaluations/` - Product and feature evaluations
- `/in-progress-docs/archive/` - Outdated content pending review

### Standardized Templates

Created standardized templates for different document types:
- Reference documentation
- Architecture documentation
- Technical guides
- Development journals
- Planning documents
- Evaluation documents

### Documentation Classification

Established clear criteria for when documentation belongs in the wiki vs. in-progress-docs:
- Stability of content
- Comprehensiveness
- Ongoing relevance
- Reference value for development

### Updated References

- Updated README.md with new documentation structure
- Updated CLAUDE.md with reference tables linking to key documentation
- Created cross-references between related documents

## Documentation Lifecycle

The documentation now follows a clearly defined lifecycle:
1. Creation as working documents in `in-progress-docs/`
2. Review during milestone completion or periodic evaluation
3. Migration to `wiki/` for stable, reference content when appropriate
4. Regular review to maintain accuracy and relevance

## Completed High-Priority Migrations

The following high-priority documents have been migrated to the new structure:

1. **Security Documentation**
   - Security Architecture → `/wiki/security/architecture.md`
   - Security Implementation → `/wiki/security/implementation.md`

2. **Engineering Standards**
   - Development Standards → `/wiki/engineering/standards/development-standards.md`
   - Error Codes Reference → `/wiki/engineering/reference/error-codes.md`

## Remaining Work

Some medium and low priority migrations remain to be completed:

1. **Medium Priority**
   - Project roadmap and milestone documentation to wiki structure
   - Component documentation for frontend and backend

2. **Low Priority**
   - Moving development journals to in-progress-docs structure
   - Creating additional cross-references between documents

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Clearer organization makes finding information easier
2. **Better Maintenance**: Separation of stable vs. evolving content
3. **Standardized Format**: Consistent templates improve readability
4. **Clear Lifecycle**: Process for documentation evolution and review
5. **Reduced Duplication**: Better organization prevents duplicate content

## Recommendations for Continued Maintenance

1. Follow the document classification criteria when creating new documentation
2. Use the appropriate templates for new documents
3. Conduct quarterly reviews of in-progress-docs for potential wiki migration
4. Update cross-references when documents move between directories
5. Keep the reference tables in CLAUDE.md updated with new key documentation
