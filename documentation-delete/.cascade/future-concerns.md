# Future Concerns & Technical Debt

This document consolidates issues, improvements, and concerns that have been identified but deferred for future milestones. This helps track technical debt and ensures important considerations aren't lost.

## API & Backend Concerns

### 1. Error Mapping Between Domain and Edge Layers

**Issue:** Manual mapping of domain-specific errors to Edge API errors is currently done case-by-case. As the application grows, this approach will become increasingly tedious and error-prone.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Create a centralized error mapping registry or dictionary
- Build an automatic error translation middleware
- Implement a class-based error hierarchy that handles translations
- Generate error mappings from OpenAPI specifications

**Target Milestone:** 0009 or 0010 (after authentication is implemented)

### 2. Message Normalization for Complex Scenarios

**Issue:** The current `normalizeThreadMessages` utility only sorts messages by createdAt timestamp. Future features like streaming LLM responses, parallel message generation, or handling race conditions will require more sophisticated handling.

**Potential Enhancements:**
- Use Message.status field to determine message ordering and visibility
- Implement reconciliation logic for handling interrupted or failed streaming messages
- Add metadata support for tracking message relationships

**Target Milestone:** 0008-0009 (during LLM integration)

### 3. OpenAPI Specification Generation

**Issue:** Currently maintaining OpenAPI specifications manually, which could lead to drift between implementation and documentation.

**Potential Solution:** Implement tooling to automatically generate or validate OpenAPI specs from the codebase.

**Target Milestone:** 0010+

### 4. Request Rate Limiting

**Issue:** No protection against API abuse currently implemented.

**Potential Solution:** Add rate limiting middleware with appropriate configuration for different endpoints.

**Target Milestone:** 0010+

## Database & Persistence Concerns

### 1. Database Migration Strategy

**Issue:** As the application evolves, we'll need a structured approach to database schema changes.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Implement a migration framework (e.g., node-migrate)
- Create versioned database schemas with upgrade paths
- Implement automatic schema verification on startup

**Target Milestone:** 0009+

### 2. Cross-Platform Database Path Handling

**Issue:** Current database path handling may have edge cases in different environments.

**Potential Solution:** Enhance path resolution logic to be more robust across different operating systems and deployment configurations.

**Target Milestone:** 0010+

## Authentication & Security Concerns

### 1. Authentication Implementation

**Issue:** Currently no authentication system is implemented, as it's planned for Milestone 0008.

**Requirements:**
- User management
- JWT token implementation
- API key storage for LLM services
- Role-based access control

**Target Milestone:** 0008

### 2. Password Storage

**Issue:** Will need secure password storage once user authentication is implemented.

**Requirements:**
- Use industry-standard hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Implement proper salt handling
- Add password complexity requirements

**Target Milestone:** 0008

### 3. API Keys Security

**Issue:** Need secure storage and handling of third-party API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).

**Requirements:**
- Encrypted storage of API keys
- Environment variable support
- Per-user API key management

**Target Milestone:** 0008-0009

## Performance Concerns

### 1. Large Response Handling

**Issue:** No specific handling for potentially large response bodies (e.g., long conversation histories).

**Potential Solutions:**
- Implement pagination for large collections
- Add streaming support for large response bodies
- Consider compression for network efficiency

**Target Milestone:** 0009+

### 2. Caching Strategy

**Issue:** No caching strategy currently implemented.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Implement HTTP caching headers
- Add in-memory cache for frequently accessed data
- Consider Redis for distributed caching in multi-instance deployments

**Target Milestone:** 0010+

## Maintenance & Operational Concerns

### 1. Context Token Limits

**Issue:** Growing codebase size is approaching GPT context token limits.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Optimize redundancy in files included in project-prompt.md
- Summarize dev journals or create a 'Key Decisions & Learnings Log'
- Ensure project-prompt.md is an aggressive summary of critical parts

**Target Milestone:** Ongoing

### 2. Test Coverage Standards

**Issue:** Need to maintain high test coverage as codebase grows.

**Requirement:** Enforce the 80% coverage threshold for lines, functions, statements, and branches across the codebase.

**Target Milestone:** Ongoing

## UI & Frontend Concerns

### 1. UI Implementation

**Issue:** Frontend UI implementation is planned for future milestones.

**Requirements:**
- React TypeScript implementation
- Integration with Edge API
- Responsive design
- Accessibility compliance

**Target Milestone:** TBD (frontend milestone)

### 2. Real-time Updates

**Issue:** Need mechanism for pushing updates to connected clients.

**Potential Solutions:**
- WebSocket implementation
- Server-Sent Events
- Polling with appropriate backoff strategy

**Target Milestone:** TBD (frontend milestone)

## Documentation Concerns

### 1. API Documentation Versioning

**Issue:** Need strategy for versioning API documentation as the API evolves.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Implement versioned OpenAPI specifications
- Add version selector to Swagger UI
- Maintain changelog for API changes

**Target Milestone:** 0010+

### 2. Developer Documentation

**Issue:** As the codebase grows, need better structured developer documentation.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Implement JSDoc to TypeDoc generation
- Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Maintain component and integration diagrams

**Target Milestone:** Ongoing
