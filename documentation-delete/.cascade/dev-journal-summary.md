# Development Journal Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all development journals for the Liminal Type Chat project, organized by milestone.

## Milestone 0: Project Initialization

**Status:** Complete  
**Key Accomplishments:**
- Established proper architectural folder structure
- Set up SQLite database location in `/server/db/`
- Implemented Domain Client Adapter Pattern supporting in-process vs HTTP modes
- Created a strategy for LLM providers, focusing on OpenAI BYOK first
- Established standardized error handling system with hierarchical codes
- Set up code style enforcement with ESLint/Prettier
- Configured Jest with coverage thresholds (90% for domain services, 80% elsewhere)

**Technical Decisions:**
- Selected better-sqlite3 v11.10.0+ for Node.js 23 compatibility
- Created centralized config module for environment variables
- Restructured project to align with the architectural vision (separate server/client)

## Milestone 1: Basic HTTP Server & Domain Health Endpoint

**Status:** Complete  
**Key Accomplishments:**
- Established the Node.js/Express.js application with architectural folder structure
- Implemented domain health check endpoint
- Created comprehensive test coverage
- Developed standardized error handling system

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created hierarchical error categorization (1000-1999, 2000-2999, etc.)
- Implemented one-to-many HTTP status mapping for granular error reporting
- Developed consistent error response format with environment-specific details
- Built domain health service with `getSystemStatus()` functionality
- Achieved 100% test coverage for both components

## Milestone 2: SQLite Database Connectivity & Health Check

**Status:** Complete  
**Key Accomplishments:**
- Implemented SQLite database connectivity using better-sqlite3
- Created a lightweight DatabaseProvider interface
- Developed SQLiteProvider implementation
- Added health check table and schema initialization
- Extended HealthService to include database connection checks
- Created database health check endpoint
- Developed visual dashboard for health endpoint testing

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used an interface pattern for database operations to maintain separation of concerns
- Implemented the SQLiteProvider with initialization, query execution, transactions
- Created a health_checks table for tracking system health over time
- Extended `/api/v1/domain/health/db` endpoint for database status

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Database initialization at startup
- Consistent error handling across operations
- Testing database operations with in-memory SQLite instances

## Milestone 3: Edge-to-Domain Communication

**Status:** Complete  
**Key Accomplishments:**
- Implemented domain client adapter pattern
- Created HealthServiceClient interface
- Developed both direct (in-process) and HTTP implementations
- Built factory function for client instantiation
- Created edge routes using the domain client
- Enhanced visual dashboard for testing both tiers
- Created server management scripts

**Technical Implementation:**
- Clean separation between edge tier (API endpoints) and domain tier (business logic)
- Support for both direct and HTTP communication modes
- Factory pattern for client creation based on configuration
- Edge routes that delegate to domain clients

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Error propagation across communication boundaries
- Testing HTTP client without actual HTTP requests
- Server port management for development

## Milestone 4: React TypeScript Frontend

**Status:** Complete  
**Key Accomplishments:**
- Implemented React TypeScript frontend with modern UI library (Chakra UI)
- Created component architecture with reusability in mind
- Developed typed client services for API integration
- Implemented comprehensive testing strategy
- Created streamlined build and deployment process
- Set up GitHub Actions CI workflow

**Technical Implementation:**
- Component hierarchy with Header, HealthDashboard, HealthCheckCard, Footer
- API integration with type safety and error handling
- React's built-in state management with hooks
- Testing with Vitest and React Testing Library
- Simplified CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive verification steps

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Ensuring type safety between frontend and backend
- Testing components with API dependencies
- Integrating React build with Express server
- Maintaining high test coverage standards

## Milestone 6: Core ContextThread Domain Layer

**Status:** Complete  
**Key Accomplishments:**
- Implemented core domain logic for ContextThread and Message models
- Created database schema and repository layer
- Developed service layer with business logic
- Added domain API routes for threads and messages
- Achieved high test coverage across all components

**Technical Implementation:**
- Domain models for ContextThread and Message
- SQLite implementation with denormalized approach
- ContextThreadRepository for CRUD operations
- ContextThreadService for business logic
- Utilities like normalizeThreadMessages
- RESTful API endpoints for threads and messages

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Async route handlers optimization
- JSON parsing error handling with custom errors
- Balancing denormalization trade-offs

## Milestone 7: ContextThread Name Standardization

**Status:** In Progress  
**Current Focus:**
- Standardizing naming conventions for ContextThread terminology
- Ensuring consistency in method names, interfaces, and documentation
- Following test-driven development practices

**Changes Made:**
- Renamed interfaces:
  - `CreateThreadParams` → `CreateContextThreadParams`
  - `UpdateThreadParams` → `UpdateContextThreadParams`
- Renamed methods:
  - `createThread` → `createContextThread`
  - `getThread` → `getContextThread`
  - `updateThread` → `updateContextThread`
  - `addMessage` → `addMessageToContextThread`
  - `deleteThread` → `deleteContextThread`
- Created new test file for standardized naming
- Updated documentation to reflect changes

**Next Steps:**
- Update client interfaces (Direct and HTTP)
- Modify domain API routes for consistent terminology
- Update edge API transformers
- Review OpenAPI specification
- Complete documentation updates

## Project-Wide CI/CD Implementation

**Status:** Complete  
**Key Features:**
- GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
- Comprehensive verification steps including:
  - Linting for both server and client code
  - Building server and client components
  - Running tests with coverage requirements
  - Security auditing
- Coverage thresholds set at 80% for line, function, statement, and branch coverage
- Single job approach for simplicity and resource efficiency

**Benefits:**
- Early issue detection in the development process
- Prevention of code regression through strict requirements
- Maintenance of code quality and standards throughout development
