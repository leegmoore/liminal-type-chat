# Development Approach

Liminal Type Chat will be developed in incremental milestones, each delivering a thin slice of complete functionality from database to UI:

- **MVP 1**: Focus on core infrastructure, health endpoints, and basic architecture patterns (See `10-mvp-001-milestones.md`)
- **MVP 2**: Once MVP 1 is complete, new milestones will be defined for conversation functionality
- **Future MVPs**: Will add advanced features like multi-LLM orchestration, plugins, etc.

Each milestone follows these principles:
- Delivers end-to-end functionality (from database to UI)
- Includes comprehensive tests
- Establishes patterns that will scale to future features
- Results in a deployable, working system (even if limited in scope)

This approach allows for early validation of architectural decisions and creates a foundation for progressive enhancement.
