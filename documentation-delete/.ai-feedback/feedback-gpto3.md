### Independent Code & Security Review (o3 Flagship)

---

#### 1. Architecture & Design Fit

**Tiered split (Domain → Edge → UI)**  
• Clean separation; Domain-Client-Adapter keeps tiers decoupled.  
• Good flexibility: local-first now, light cloud later.  
• Keep DTOs out of Domain; consider a small `shared-types` package.

**Database: SQLite + better-sqlite3**  
• Ideal for local, single-user setups.  
• Heavy concurrent cloud use may need an async driver or Postgres.  
• Make DB path configurable via env (`./data/liminal.db` by default).

**Node + Express**  
• Battle-tested and minimal.  
• Add `helmet`, CORS, and basic rate limiting on day-one.

**React + Chakra UI**  
• Modern, accessible dashboard stack.  
• Sanitize any user-supplied HTML to avoid XSS.

**Testing goals (90 % Domain / 80 % rest)**  
• Ambitious and healthy. Add negative-path tests (bad payloads, DB failures).

*Verdict:* Architecture and stack suit the power-user, BYOK chatbot scenario without over-engineering.

#### 2. Security & Open-Source Readiness

**Secrets & sensitive data**  
• No hard-coded secrets found; `.env` pattern is good.  
• Ensure `.env` is git-ignored and `.env.example` uses placeholders only.

**Dependencies**  
• Activate Dependabot and fail CI on high/critical `npm audit` findings.

**API input validation**  
• Adopt `zod` or `joi` in Edge routes to strongly validate payloads.

**Error handling**  
• Never expose raw stack traces to clients; log them server-side only.

**Synchronous DB access**  
• Fine for desktop use; if Edge is internet-exposed, consider async driver or small task queue to avoid event-loop blocking.

**Transport-layer hardening**  
• Enable CORS with an allow-list.  
• Basic rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`).  
• Use HTTPS for any cloud deployment.

#### 3. Recommended Security-Scanning Workflow

1. **Local pre-commit:**  
   • `eslint` with `eslint-plugin-security`.  
   • `gitleaks protect --staged` via Husky.

2. **CI on every push/PR (GitHub Actions):**
   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run lint
   npm test -- --coverage
   npm audit --audit-level=high
   gitleaks detect --exit-code 1
   codeql-action/init && codeql-action/analyze
   ```

3. **GitHub services:**  
   • Dependabot for deps.  
   • Built-in secret scanning (public repos).

4. **Quarterly manual:**  
   • OWASP ZAP crawl against running Edge server (if public).

---

#### 4. Potential Blind Spots

* **Database migrations:** add `drizzle-kit` or `knex` before new tables arrive.  
* **Background orchestration:** introduce a lightweight job queue early.  
* **Shared DTO duplication:** create `@liminal/shared` types to avoid drift.  
* **Synchronous file I/O:** keep heavy ops to startup, not request path.

#### 5. First-Commit Checklist

- [x] `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, builds, OS files, `node_modules`.  
- [x] README warns about local-data privacy responsibilities.  
- [x] License file included.  
- [x] No personal data or proprietary info in docs.  
- [x] Example env files use placeholders.

#### 6. Overall Verdict

The codebase is solid, well-structured, and safe to open-source. No blocking security risks found. Implement the suggested CI scans and minor hardening steps, and you’re in excellent shape.
